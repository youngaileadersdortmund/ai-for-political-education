The Free Democrats in Dortmund stand and fight for the values of liberal democracy - also in local politics.
Individual freedom is the core of our actions.
We stand for an open, tolerant society in which different identities and lifestyles are welcome.
A liberal society is based on a strong state governed by the rule of law.

Together.
For everyone.
For you.
Now.
