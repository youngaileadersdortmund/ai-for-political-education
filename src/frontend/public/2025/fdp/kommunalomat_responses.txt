All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - 

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Neutral - A relevant part of the school materials is already free of charge for everyone today. For other school materials, parents in need receive subsidies from the Job Centre. We want to continue this practice.

Students at secondary schools should not receive free iPads:
Strong Rejection - Tablets are part of digital education, and they must be accessible to every student.

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Strong Rejection - In many parts of the city, schools can be reached by public transport, and school buses would be unnecessarily expensive.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund â€“ also in writing:
Neutral - We see a useful overview for voluntary services. The city is not the right contact for professions. It is more useful to obtain information from the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the Chamber of Crafts and the vocational information centre of the Federal Employment Agency. Their contact details should be referred to. This is, by the way, more the task of teachers than the city administration.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Strong Approval - 

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - 

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Rejection - Pupils need a good quality lunch. This is not something that should be given away for free, so a contribution from parents is justified. In particular, it would be questionable if well-off parents were to be relieved at the expense of taxpayers. For children from poorer families, targeted solutions must be found. This includes the acquisition of funding, sponsors and volunteers.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Neutral - Offers of the type named are already more or less available everywhere.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Neutral - The city of Dortmund already has a comprehensive network of libraries. Extending opening hours may be appropriate, but further facilities do not seem appropriate.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Neutral - Our priority is to provide comprehensive coverage of school social work and the establishment of multiprofessional teams in the areas mentioned. Whether a tandem solution is necessary, efficient and financially viable at each school must be discussed. This is not something that can be financed from the city's funds. This would be the responsibility of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Approval - 

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Strong Rejection - The public sector provides a comprehensive public transport system and already subsidises a bike rental system. Even more extensive subsidies cannot be included in the city budget - because they increase the already high debts that the younger generation will have to pay off later.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Approval - We are in favour of expansion based on demand, i.e. expansion when actual use is proven.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Approval - 

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Rejection - For one thing, the city is not responsible for ticket prices, but rather the VRR. For another, fewer revenues for the transport companies mean less quality in public transport. You can't have both: pay nothing or little, but still want good service.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Approval - The bottleneck here is less the money than the lack of drivers, and while we are in favour of expanding this, it must be clear that this can only be done gradually - as was the case recently with the extended operating hours of the Stadtbahn at night.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Neutral - For most pupils, local public transport is already free or very cheap.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Approval - There are important light rail expansion projects. However, these require a very long lead time. We see short-term solutions for connecting the outer city districts more in better bus connections and in ride sharing, i.e. digitally coordinated shared taxis.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Approval - 

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - 

The use of flashing lights is to be avoided to increase traffic safety:
Strong Rejection - 

Traffic lights in Dortmund are to be checked at least once a month:
Strong Rejection - That is an unrealistic effort. More important and feasible are faster reactions to reported disruptions.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - Es is necessary to invest more in pedestrian traffic. The FDP has already submitted corresponding applications in the last election period.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Neutral - There must be access to appropriate sports facilities, but there may also be sites where shared use with other schools nearby is a better solution.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Neutral - We support the idea of sports boxes, but before they are installed everywhere, experiences should first be gathered at individual locations.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Strong Rejection - Dortmund currently has major problems with the stability of the existing indoor pool facilities. These must be solved before promising an expansion. It should be noted that the public transport connection between many districts of the city is good. It does not make sense, for example, to build a swimming pool in the east of the city centre at great expense, even though indoor pools in other districts of the city can be reached very quickly by bus and train.

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Neutral - Dortmund needs an attractive nightlife. However, it is not the city's task to "provide" land for commercial purposes. What is probably meant is that the city planning of the city of Dortmund takes into account areas where clubs and discos can be operated without problems with the neighbors. We are in favor of this.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - 

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Approval - 

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Strong Approval - The FDP is advocating, among other things, the abolition of special usage fees for outdoor catering, which would reduce the costs for catering businesses.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - 

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Approval - At least when it comes to urban construction projects, we want to involve young people through a youth parliament, similar to the senior citizens' council.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - 

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - As a public employer, the city has a leading role in integrating people with disabilities into the primary labour market.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Strong Approval - 

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Rejection - The existing instrumentarium of requirements for construction projects is sufficient. It is more important that unnecessary bureaucracy, which hinders housing construction, is reduced.

The basic tax in Dortmund is to rise.:
Strong Rejection - If the land tax rises, the rents will rise, because the land tax can be passed on in full to the tenants.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - 

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Rejection - The city cannot provide rooms to all groups and associations indiscriminately. We would reject this for right-wing radical associations or groups just as we would for religious fundamentalist and left-wing extremist groups.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - 

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Approval - 

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - 

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - 

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Approval - We strongly support the basic idea. This is an important measure for climate adaptation. However, this will not be feasible everywhere, as certain uses (Christmas markets, concerts, etc.) would otherwise have to be restricted.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Approval - To this end, the FDP in the council in the last election period initiated the examination of the specific structural possibilities. The installation should take place within the scope of the financial possibilities. However, this should not be at the expense of the renovation of classrooms, roofs or toilet facilities in schools.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - 

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Approval - We want to expand the visible security service in the subways. However, realistically, implementation in every single subway is not feasible in terms of personnel.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Approval - 

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - 

Drop-in centres are to be set up in every district for gay youths:
Rejection - Es is better to offer central services in the city (counselling, youth centres etc.) for queer youths, rather than having a single point of contact in each district.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - 

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Neutral - We support inclusion in education. However, good inclusion requires a corresponding material and personnel outfit. In addition, depending on the type and severity of the disability, it may be better for the children to be supported in a special needs school. Therefore, we want both inclusive offers and special needs schools in Dortmund.

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - 

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Approval - 

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - 

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval -
