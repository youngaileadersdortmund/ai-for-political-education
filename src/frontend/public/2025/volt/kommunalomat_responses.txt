All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - Equal opportunities in education begin with the equipment of schools.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - The question of whether a book should be purchased should not depend on the income of the parents.

Students at secondary schools should not receive free iPads:
Strong Rejection - Especially in secondary schools, current hardware and software must be made available free of charge.

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Strong Approval - In individual cases, school buses may be unnecessary, for example in the case of very compact catchment areas or good tram connections. But in principle, every school should have a school bus. The widespread use of school buses is made possible by better coordinated school start times.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund â€“ also in writing:
Strong Approval - Young people are thinking about their future careers. Many of them lack an overview of their options. At the same time, many training places remain unfilled. The city must take action.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Strong Approval - There are many offers that are not used very much because they are not well enough known. This is just as bad for the children and young people as it is for the clubs and organisations.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - The condition of many outdoor areas is alarming and in some cases even dangerous. This must change.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - For many children in Dortmund, a midday meal is unfortunately not a given. This is to change. In the long term, most schools are to be equipped with their own school kitchens.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Strong Approval - Where there are no free learning and education offers, such offers must be created urgently.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Strong Approval - The tasks of libraries are different today than in the past, but they remain important public places of learning. We need more of these offers, also as an extension of schools.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - The sooner socially conspicuous behaviour and psychological problems are recognised and treated, the more sustainable the help will be. This requires short distances and fixed contact persons.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Strong Approval - Up to now, there are far too few preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic offers for young people.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Strong Approval - The use of rental bicycles should be possible with the ticket for bus and train. This ticket should be free for young people.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Strong Approval - Rental bikes are only interesting if they are close enough to the starting point and can be parked at the destination, which is why a dense network of bike parking spaces is required.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - White lines or red paint alone do not make cycle paths safe. Cycle paths must be wide enough and, if possible, physically separated from the road.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval - The hurdle for using bus and train must be lowered as much as possible.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - Bus lines are only useful if the buses run frequently enough to be a real alternative to the car.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Strong Approval - If children and young people can travel by bus and train at any time and without any problems, they will do so much more often as adults.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Strong Approval - In particular, existing tram lines are to be extended into the outer areas.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Strong Approval - Parent taxis exacerbate the problem they are trying to combat, because the fear of the dangers of road traffic means that more children are taken to school by car, which increases the danger for everyone else.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - Emergency buttons must be standard equipment in all train stations.

The use of flashing lights is to be avoided to increase traffic safety:
Strong Rejection - The use of speed cameras demonstrably increases road safety.

Traffic lights in Dortmund are to be checked at least once a month:
Strong Approval - Where traffic lights cannot be replaced by roundabouts or zebra crossings, traffic lights should permanently monitor their condition electronically and report it. Until this works across the board, regular checks must take place.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - Safe routes are the basic prerequisite for more people to walk or cycle.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Strong Approval - Multi-purpose sports grounds are an important leisure-time facility even outside school hours. Since they can be of different sizes and can be used for many different sports, they should be planned for all school locations.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Strong Approval - Sports boxes are a good offer to make it easier for people to exercise outdoors.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Strong Approval - The proportion of people who can swim is decreasing, and we need to counteract this by creating widespread opportunities to learn how to swim. In addition, swimming is a healthy leisure activity that we want to promote.

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Strong Approval - There are too few clubs and discos in Dortmund to reflect the variety of all cultures, styles and tastes. In order for new clubs to be able to settle, the city must offer suitable areas to interested operators.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - A free-to-use WLAN network must be part of the basic supply in the central squares of the city, even outside the city centre.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - Good leisure and educational offers are only useful if they are known. An online portal that presents these offers completely, but in an orderly manner, is long overdue.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Strong Approval - Hospitality is an important part of public life and is hugely important for vibrant neighbourhood centres.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - Anyone who lives here must be able to contribute. This applies in particular to all issues and projects that affect one's own neighbourhood, but also the whole city. No one should be excluded.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - Young people must be given the same opportunity to participate in planning processes as older people. To achieve this, they must be specifically addressed and suitable formats for dialogue must be chosen.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - Political education is enormously important in times of far-reaching disinformation. The city must make its contribution so that young people know how politics works locally and how they can get involved themselves. Digital offers are particularly effective in reaching young people.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - Municipal undertakings can and should take on special responsibility and lead by example, including in relation to the employment of people with disabilities.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Strong Approval - Trainees in particular, with their low incomes, need accommodation that they can afford. Hostels have established themselves in some areas, for example in hospitals.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Strong Approval - The proportion of publicly funded construction is quite obviously too low to guarantee a roof over the heads of all people in Dortmund.

The basic tax in Dortmund is to rise.:
Strong Rejection - An increase in property taxes will lead to higher rents. This will particularly affect those who are already struggling financially.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - Offers for young people must be available across the board.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Approval - Many clubs already have their own rooms or require special equipment. Nevertheless, the city should expand the offer of usable rooms for clubs. However, Nazis should stay at home.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - Without funding, nothing can be done with social measures anymore. Every euro counts.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Strong Approval - German is a difficult language and it takes a long time to learn it, which is why it is important to provide information in all relevant languages.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - The degree of contamination of the pavements also depends on the insufficient number of public litter bins.

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - There are only very few drinking fountains in Dortmund. This is to change.

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - Especially in large spaces, trees can greatly increase the quality of the environment.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - Solar installations must become a standard part of construction.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - There are too few public toilets in Dortmund. That has to change.

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Strong Approval - Security forces can de-escalate if necessary and prevent crimes by their mere presence.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Strong Approval - The authorities have a great responsibility when it comes to dealing with people of different ethnicities. This alone obliges them to undergo training in culturally sensitive behaviour.

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - Queer people need safe spaces and services. Currently, there are still too few of them.

Drop-in centres are to be set up in every district for gay youths:
Strong Approval - For example, in schools there should be trained contact persons for queer youth.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - Queerness is a part of everyday life. Staff in schools and youth facilities must be able to deal with it.

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - Inclusion is a community task and must therefore be solved jointly by all schools. For this, resources must be made available.

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - Accessibility is a must.

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Strong Approval - At the moment there are still too few inclusive holiday offers.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - Without support, it is often not possible for young people with disabilities to choose a profession that is suitable for them.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - Bureaucracy must not further restrict people with disabilities.
