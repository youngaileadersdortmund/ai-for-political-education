Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the open election compass answers and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by the political program. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the provided answers and pick out the key points related to the city's appearance. The answers cover a lot of areas: education, transportation, public spaces, accessibility, etc. But the focus here is on visual aspects.

Looking at the points mentioned, things like school facilities, public transport, bike infrastructure, green spaces, and public amenities come to mind. Let me list possible aspects:

1. **Clean and well-maintained school environments** – The answer mentions regular cleaning of school areas, which affects the visual appearance of schools.
2. **Expanded public bike infrastructure** – There's a lot about bike paths, parking, and rentals, which would change the city's look with more bike lanes and stations.
3. **Green spaces and tree planting** – The program includes planting trees and improving street greenery, directly affecting the city's visual appeal.
4. **Modernized public transportation facilities** – New tram connections, bus lanes, and improved stations would alter the city's visual landscape.
5. **Accessible and inclusive public spaces** – Features like barrier-free designs, sports facilities, and youth centers contribute to the visual aspects of inclusivity.

Wait, need to make sure each is a visual aspect. Let me check each point again. For example, "clean school environments" is visual. "Bike infrastructure" is visual. "Green spaces" are visual. "Public transport facilities" like stations and bike lanes. "Inclusive public spaces" like accessible parks and facilities.

I think these five cover different areas. Now, need to phrase each concisely, 3-6 words. Maybe:

- Clean school environments
- Expanded bike infrastructure
- Enhanced green spaces
- Modernized transit hubs
- Inclusive public spaces

That's five. Let me verify if these are all directly related to visual aspects and not just services. Yes, they all relate to the physical appearance of the city. The answer seems to fit.
