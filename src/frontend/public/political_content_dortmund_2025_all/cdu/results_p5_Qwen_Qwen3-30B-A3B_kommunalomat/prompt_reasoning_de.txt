Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze the open election compass answers and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by the political program. Each aspect needs to be a concise description, 3-6 words, and returned as a comma-separated list.
First, I need to go through each of the provided answers and look for elements that relate to the visual aspects of the city. Visual aspects could include things like infrastructure, public spaces, signage, cleanliness, etc.
Looking at the first point: "All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment." That's about school interiors, but maybe not directly a city appearance. However, if all schools have similar equipment, it might contribute to a more uniform look in educational institutions, but maybe not the city's overall appearance.
Next, "All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund - also in writing." This seems more about information dissemination, not visual aspects.
"The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city." Again, information, not visual.
"The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends." Cleaning affects the cleanliness of school areas, which is a visual aspect. So "Clean school exteriors" could be one.
"There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district." This might involve public spaces, but not sure about visual aspects.
"The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries." Libraries are public buildings, so "Expanded libraries" could be a visual aspect.
"Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists." Not visual.
"The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people." Again, not visual.
"Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes." Bike parking is infrastructure, so "Increased bike parking" is a visual aspect.
"Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer." Safer cycle paths might involve markings or structures, so "Safer cycle paths" as a visual change.
"Buses and trains are to run more frequently..." Not visual, more about transportation frequency.
"The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections." Tram connections could affect the city's infrastructure, so "Improved tram access" as a visual aspect.
"Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted." This might affect the appearance of school areas, but maybe not directly. "Restricted parent taxi zones" could be a point, but maybe not as visual.
"Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations." Emergency call buttons are visible, so "Emergency call buttons" as a visual element.
"Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded." Safer routes might involve signage or infrastructure, so "Safer pedestrian routes" as a visual aspect.
"Sports boxes are to be installed in every district." Sports boxes are physical structures, so "Sports boxes installed" is a visual aspect.
"The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos." Land for clubs might affect the cityscape, but not sure. Maybe "New club spaces" as a visual aspect.
"The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts." Wi-Fi is more about infrastructure, but not a visual aspect.
"An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up." Online portal is digital, not visual.
"The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted." Restaurants are buildings, so "More restaurants in outskirts" as a visual aspect.
"The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate." Not visual.
"Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning..." Involving youth in planning might lead to changes in public spaces, so "Youth-influenced urban design" as a visual aspect.
"The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics." Digital offers, not visual.
"People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses." Not visual.
"Separate homes are to be built for trainees." Trainee housing is buildings, so "Trainee housing built" as a visual aspect.
"Offers for young people are to be created in every district." This could involve public spaces, so "Youth centers in districts" as a visual aspect.
"The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations." Rooms for groups, so "Community rooms available" as a visual aspect.
"The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures." Funding, not visual.
"The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language." Multilingual signs, so "Multilingual signage" as a visual aspect.
"More public litter bins are to be installed in the city." Litter bins are visible, so "More public litter bins" as a visual aspect.
"Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces." Drinking fountains are visible, so "Hygienic drinking fountains" as a visual aspect.
"Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade." Tree planting affects the city's greenery, so "More street trees" as a visual aspect.
"Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels." Solar panels are visible on buildings, so "Solar panels on buildings" as a visual aspect.
"The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center." Public toilets are visible, so "More public restrooms" as a visual aspect.
"Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night." Patrols might not be a visual aspect, but the presence of security could be, but maybe not. "Increased security presence" as a visual aspect.
"All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism." Training is not visual.
"Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund." Inclusive facilities, so "Inclusive school facilities" as a visual aspect.
"Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free." Barrier-free design, so "Barrier-free facilities" as a visual aspect.
"More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people." Not directly visual.
"Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices."
"Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way." Not visual.
Now, compiling the top five visual aspects from the above:
1. Clean school exteriors (from the cleaning of outside areas)
2. Safer cycle paths (from making cycle paths safer)
3. Expanded libraries (from establishing more public learning spaces like libraries)
4. More public litter bins (from installing more bins)
5. More street trees (from planting trees for shade)
Wait, but I need to make sure these are the most impactful. Let me check again.
Other possible aspects:
- Increased bike parking (from more bike parking spaces)
- Improved tram access (from better connecting outer districts)
- Safer pedestrian routes (from expanding safe routes)
- Sports boxes installed (from installing sports boxes)
- Solar panels on buildings (from equipping with solar panels)
- Hygienic drinking fountains (from providing them)
- Multilingual signage (from providing info in multiple languages)
- More public restrooms (from setting up additional toilets)
- Youth centers in districts (from creating offers in every district)
- Inclusive school facilities (from inclusive offers)
But the user asked for 5 important ones. Which ones are most directly visual?
Clean school exteriors, safer cycle paths, expanded libraries, more public litter bins, and more street trees. Alternatively, maybe safer pedestrian routes, solar panels, etc. But I need to pick the top 5. Let me go with the first five I thought of.
