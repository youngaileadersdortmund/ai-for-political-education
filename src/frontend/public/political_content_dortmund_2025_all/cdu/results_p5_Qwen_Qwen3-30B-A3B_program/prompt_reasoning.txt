Okay, I need to figure out the five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by the CDU's election program. Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.

First, the CDU talks about making the city centre inviting again with lively squares, attractive shops, and safe streets. That sounds like urban design and public spaces. Then they mention the move of the Technical University into the Hansa Carr√© and cultural events in the Stadtgarten. So maybe public spaces and cultural areas. 

They also mention energy-efficient renovations, green roofs, and photovoltaics. That's environmental aspects, like green infrastructure. The part about bike & ride facilities and cycle routes points to transportation infrastructure. 

There's a focus on reducing crime, improving security, and the municipal order service. That might relate to cleanliness and public safety, which are visual aspects. Also, the mention of a "healthy environment" and climate change adaptation could tie into green spaces and sustainable design.

Another point is the housing program for young families, creating 2,500 residential units, and affordable housing. That's about residential areas and urban development. The "newPark" project and development of the former HSP area suggest urban renewal and green spaces. 

They also talk about digitalization, smart city initiatives, and broadband expansion. While that's more about technology, it might influence the city's aesthetics through smart infrastructure. However, the question is about visual aspects, so maybe not directly. 

The cultural aspects like the "family card" for discounts and cultural events in the city could relate to public art or cultural spaces. But the main visual aspects might be more about physical structures. 

So compiling this, the five aspects could be:

1. Lively public squares (from the city centre being inviting)
2. Green roofs and energy-efficient buildings (environmental policy)
3. Improved cycle paths and bike infrastructure (mobility)
4. Clean and safe streets (security and order)
5. Cultural and recreational spaces (events, parks, etc.)

I need to check if these are all covered in the text and if there are other aspects. The housing program affects residential areas, but maybe that's part of urban development. The "newPark" project is about green spaces. Also, the mention of a "smart city" might influence infrastructure visuals, but maybe that's not as direct. 

Alternatively, the "digital map" for cycle routes and the "smart city" could relate to digital signage or tech integration, but the user asked for visual aspects, so maybe not. 

So sticking with the five I listed. Now, each needs to be concise, 3-6 words. Let me rephrase:

1. Lively public squares and shops
2. Green roofs and energy-efficient facades
3. Expanded bike lanes and pedestrian zones
4. Clean, well-lit streets and public areas
5. Cultural venues and open green spaces

That should cover the main points. Let me verify each against the program. Yes, the city centre with squares and shops, green roofs, cycle paths, security (clean streets), and cultural spaces. Looks good.
