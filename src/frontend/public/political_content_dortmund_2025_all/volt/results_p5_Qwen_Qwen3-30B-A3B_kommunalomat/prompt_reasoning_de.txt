Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze the open election compass answers and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city appearance affected by the political program. They need each aspect described in 3-6 words, as a comma-separated list.
First, I need to go through the list of answers provided. Each answer is a statement about policies in Dortmund. My task is to find which of these policies would impact the visual aspects of the city. So I need to think about what each policy does and how it might change the city's look.
Let me start by going through each point one by one. For example, the first one is about equipping classrooms with the same furniture and digital equipment. That's more about the interior of schools, not the city's appearance. But maybe if all schools have similar setups, it could make the city look more uniform, but that's a stretch. Maybe not the best visual aspect.
Next, free school materials. Again, more about education, not visual. Then school buses. Providing school buses might affect traffic patterns, but not directly the visual aspects. However, if there are more school buses, maybe more parking or routes, but not sure.
Information about professions for 10th graders. Not visual. Informing schools about leisure activities. Maybe more signs or info boards? Not sure. Cleaning school outdoor areas. That's about cleanliness, which is a visual aspect. So maybe "Clean outdoor areas" is one.
Free lunch for children. Maybe more school kitchens, which are buildings, but not sure. Free Wi-Fi in central areas. That's more infrastructure, maybe more public access points, but not sure if that's a visual aspect. Public multi-purpose sports fields. That's physical spaces, so "Sports fields" could be a visual aspect.
Swimming pools in every district. That's a physical structure, so "Swimming pools" is a visual aspect. Public sports boxes. "Sports boxes" as structures. More bike parking spaces. That's physical infrastructure, so "Bike parking spaces". Safer cycle paths. "Wider cycle paths" or "Safer bike lanes".
Public transport frequency. Maybe more buses, but not sure. Free public transport. Maybe more vehicles, but again, not sure. Better tram connections. "Expanded tram lines" as visual. Parent taxis restricted. Maybe less traffic, but not a visual aspect. Emergency buttons at stations. "Emergency buttons" as fixtures. Traffic lights checked monthly. "Updated traffic lights" or "Well-maintained traffic lights". Safe pedestrian routes. "Safe pedestrian paths". Multi-purpose sports fields. Already considered.
Public swimming pools. Yes. Free Wi-Fi in central areas. "Public Wi-Fi access points". Online portal for leisure. Not visual. Restaurants in outskirts. "New restaurants" as buildings. Participation formats. Not visual. Youth in town planning. Not visual. Digital political education. Not. Employing people with disabilities. Not. Trainee housing. "Trainee housing units". Social housing. "Affordable housing". Public litter bins. "More litter bins". Hygienic drinking fountains. "Drinking fountains". Trees planted. "More trees". Solar panels on buildings. "Solar panels on buildings". Public toilets. "Public restrooms". Security patrols. Not visual. Police training. Not. Safe places for queer youth. "Inclusive spaces". Drop-in centers. "Queer youth centers". Diversity training. Not. Inclusive schools. "Inclusive facilities". Barrier-free leisure. "Accessible facilities". Inclusive holiday offers. Not. Support for disabled careers. Not. Care
So from this, the visual aspects would be things like: clean outdoor areas, sports fields, swimming pools, bike parking spaces, safer cycle paths, more trees, solar panels, public restrooms, etc. But need to pick 5. Let's see which ones are most directly visual.
1. Clean outdoor areas (from the school cleaning policy)
2. Sports fields (multi-purpose sports fields)
3. Bike parking spaces (more bike parking)
4. Safer cycle paths (wider, separated paths)
5. Public restrooms (additional public toilets)
Alternatively, maybe "More trees" instead of "Public restrooms". Or "Solar panels on buildings". But the user wants 5. Let me check the original answers again to make sure.
The user's answer examples might include things like "Safer cycle paths", "Public sports fields", "Clean outdoor areas", "Bike parking spaces", "Public restrooms". That's five. Each is a visual aspect. So the final list would be those.
