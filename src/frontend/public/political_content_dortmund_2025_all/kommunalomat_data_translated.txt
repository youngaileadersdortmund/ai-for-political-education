Party 1

All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - But of course – after all, children only really learn when the whiteboard in every room shows the same error message at the same time. Equality, as we know, not only makes us happy, but also incredibly efficient: everyone waits for the Wi-Fi signal at the same time!

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - But of course - why should children have to pay for pens, exercise books and textbooks when they will have to pay off their student loans for decades anyway?

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Approval - But anyone who really thinks progressively should switch to urban ponies: they are emission-free, biodegradable and at the same time promote the next generation of equestrian sports.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund – also in writing:
Approval - But of course – how else are tenth graders supposed to remember that there are jobs beyond Insta-Reels? Please print everything out nicely on paper.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Approval - But of course! After all, we can't let the youngsters remain ignorant until they accidentally waste their free time scrolling through TikTok.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - Free lunches in schools would be nothing short of revolutionary - maybe then they'll even come up with the idea that you can learn better with a full stomach.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Approval - Absolutely – let's set up a free knowledge counter in every quarter, right next to the snack bar: once around the bend with a sharp sauce, please!

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Approval - But of course! Dortmund's secret master plan: plant a book paradise every 20 metres between the currywurst stand and the BVB fan shop. That way, you can take "War and Peace" with you to the extension during a stadium visit - and if you fall asleep while reading, you've at least found a quiet place to study.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - But yes – bring it on!

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Strong Approval - Absolutely! After all, it is completely exaggerated to assume that teenagers can solve their mental crises alone with TikTok self-diagnoses and the good old “Pull yourself together!” So, let’s have the offers.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Approval - Quite clearly: free cycling for under 18s is a must – after all, someone has to get from the maths tutoring to the Fridays for Future demo quickly, without putting their pocket money at risk.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Approval - But absolutely - every lamp is already an unofficial docking station, so a few real stands can easily professionalise the cityscape

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - Red paint is not a bike path, small walls can make the bike path safer.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval -

Party 2

All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - We stand for record investments in school construction, so that all children and young people have the best standard everywhere.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - We want to make all education free.

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Strong Approval - This depends primarily on the availability of drivers. Applications to DSW21 are welcome.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund – also in writing:
Strong Approval - With our programme with the economic development agency we are doing something even better: real companies from the neighbourhood are showing careers at schools.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Strong Approval - This is becoming more and more important, because the open day is about the neighbourhood and clubs coming to the schools.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - We will have a special program not only for cleaning but for improving the entire school grounds.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - We want to make the entire education sector free of charge. This includes a healthy lunch in kindergartens and schools.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Strong Approval - We need offers like this in our neighbourhoods, on the ground, and we want to expand this.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Strong Approval - We are currently renovating it and have even launched a completely new additional library. But we need more of these modern learning spaces and we want to finance them.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - That is the direction in which things are moving. The goal must always be that we no longer need it, but at the moment it is necessary.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Approval - For example, we have taken new paths with the loneliness department as the first city in Germany, because we have to face new challenges in a targeted way. No child or young person in Dortmund should be left behind or left alone.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Strong Approval - If you look at other countries, it would be a clever advertising measure, but the providers are not doing this in Germany so far.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Approval - We don't say no to any good provider, but in fact what you see is their offer.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - We are currently building the first closed cycle network in Dortmund, consisting of cycle routes, to open up the entire city. This will then also be safe for everyone, especially for children.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Approval - In Dortmund we invented the social ticket and we are also in favour of price reductions based on the Germany ticket, but we cannot determine this alone. From our point of view, it must become cheaper again.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - We are increasing the pace wherever we can. What is missing? People who drive, applications are welcome.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Strong Approval - We still think that this is the right thing to do and we are pushing for a majority in the council. It is already cheap in Dortmund, but it can be changed.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Approval - This has already been decided and the expansion is already starting in various places.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Approval - This has been possible for a few months and is already taking place in the first schools - where there is really a problem.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - That is actually the responsibility of Deutsche Bahn, but we also remind them of it regularly.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - That is why we are investing a lot of money, no matter what mode of transport. All routes in Dortmund must be safe, especially for children and young people.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Approval - We are currently in the process of renewing the sports area (gyms and playing fields) at many schools, which goes hand in hand with the many new and renovated schools.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Strong Approval - That is a good idea, which is already being considered in concrete terms by some sports associations. After all, the care of these sites is just as important.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Approval - We have just taken over the sports world and will maintain and renovate all the swimming pools in Dortmund. This structure has proven itself and should not be dismantled (as some would like).

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Strong Approval - This is happening. The challenge is that there are fewer people than before who are supposed to open something. We also have our own club fund, night commissioner and much more to promote the whole scene. This is only available in Dortmund.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - The programme for this is already underway, but it will still be needed until 2029 with the fibre optic expansion that is also needed for this. The goal is maximum coverage.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - We have just had a re-launch of the city's offer, now special portals for different groups are to follow.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Strong Approval - We have the only national gastronomy competition in Germany in Dortmund, where many new restaurants are created every year. But more importantly, prices need to come down. We have always been the only ones in Dortmund to argue for a lower value-added tax.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - We have gained experience here with our new formats, both digital and live. It is important that not only certain groups participate or that certain formats dominate. It is about addressing people, being on the same level and, above all, effectiveness.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - We have already collected positive examples of this in parks and leisure areas, and we want to make this the norm for places for young people.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - That is available, and we have found that you have to do both, digital and live. The digital offerings are getting better and better, but we are working on it.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - This is also a legal obligation.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Strong Approval - We have already started doing this and we want to continue doing it.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Strong Approval - We want to increase the quota for this to 40 percent, but in our opinion the city must continue to build itself. This will relieve the housing market in a very concrete way.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - We want to start a new special programme for the expansion of offers in every neighbourhood. Dortmund has always been characterised by its breadth. This will require significantly more money. And we want to become the youth capital of Europe by 2029.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Strong Approval - We want to build such places of encounter in every neighbourhood.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - The goal should always be that you don't need any subsidies for that, but until then we'll do it. Not blindly, but in a targeted way and we're quite successful at it.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Strong Approval - That is why we need even more languages, which is much easier to do digitally these days. We have learned a lot from the pandemic.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - We have increased cleaning in particularly dirty areas sixfold in some cases in recent years. Because more bins alone does not solve the problem of cleanliness, sometimes it even makes it worse if you put the wrong ones in place.

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - The programme for this started with the municipal utilities last summer and is being continually expanded.

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - This is already being implemented. We have already decided on a so-called master plan for places.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - We started this, and it is often not the city that is failing, but the providers, who often find it too complicated.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - Yes, but unfortunately there are too few free spaces for that.

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Strong Approval - We have founded our own city security service to be able to act better here. But it is not always the sole solution on site, which is why we initiated the Dortmund Guides.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Strong Approval - This is already happening.

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - With the new action plan for LSTBQ+ we want to tackle this in a targeted way. Sunrise must be expanded first.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - This is already happening.

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - What else?

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - This is the law, which is also being implemented step by step.

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Strong Approval - We are currently expanding the offer for all children and yes, that also means we need more inclusive programmes.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - In our view, all people have the right to work and to choose their profession freely.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - That is right and it really needs less bureaucracy from the state and the federal government.



Party 3

All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - Education is a human right that belongs to every child, regardless of the social status and income of their parents. The city as the school authority is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the municipal school buildings, including the same high-quality equipment for every location.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for the cost of learning materials in schools, training and studies to be taken over.

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Strong Approval - Securing school routes and transporting students must be the responsibility of the city of Dortmund. This includes cycling and walking as well as the establishment of school bus routes.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund – also in writing:
Approval - The Left is calling for the continuation and expansion of the "Startchancen" support programme and the expansion of vocational counselling in schools. However, the Left is expressly rejecting the involvement of the Bundeswehr in the classroom.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Approval - The Left is also calling for an expansion of the Dortmund Pass, in order to enable children from low-income families to participate in cultural, sports and leisure activities.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Approval - Many schoolyards, especially in densely populated neighborhoods without playgrounds, are open to the public on weekends. A schoolyard that is free of hygiene- and safety-relevant rubbish such as garbage and broken glass not only protects the students, but also contributes to a positive learning environment.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - The Left is campaigning for a free lunch for all school children in full-time care.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Strong Approval - In Dortmund, the social divide is particularly evident in the educational gap between affluent and poor neighbourhoods. The chances of achieving a high level of education and, with it, well-paid jobs are distributed extremely unequally. The school projects supported by the Left, such as "Lernen neu denken" (Thinking about learning) in the Nordstadt and the "KinderCampus Schulen" (Children's Campus Schools) in other neighbourhoods, must therefore be preserved and, if possible, expanded.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Approval - Public learning spaces such as libraries offer all people - regardless of their social background - access to knowledge, space and digital resources as a supplement to the classroom. However, here too, equal distribution in the districts must be ensured and existing structures must be expanded.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Approval - The Left is calling for well-staffed school social work - with one specialist per maximum 150 pupils - at all primary schools. Psychotherapists directly at schools could help to reduce barriers. Due to the current shortage of skilled workers, especially in child and youth psychotherapy, a comprehensive team is not realistic at the moment, but is a worthwhile goal in the medium term.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for more low-threshold offers for the mental health of young people – from school stress to trauma. This includes trauma-sensitive counselling centres for children from addicted or violent families, as well as child protection clinics that combine medical help with psychosocial counselling. These structures must be built up across the board and in the long term.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Approval - The Left supports the demand for free rental bikes for people under 18. Young people should be able to move freely - whether to school, to friends or to leisure activities. Free mobility strengthens social participation and climate protection at the same time.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for more bike parking spaces for rental bikes - especially at bus stops, in the city centre and at educational institutions. Rental systems should be in public hands so that availability and distribution can be socially and ecologically controlled. Parking space regulations must shift the focus away from cars and towards smart land use for sustainable mobility.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for the expansion of protected bike lanes, green phases independent of car traffic and the avoidance of "fear lanes" at intersections.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval - The Left in Dortmund is calling for an end to the criminalisation of poverty. This includes no longer prosecuting people for driving without a ticket. The prosecution mainly affects people who simply cannot afford a ticket. In the long term, the Left is calling for free public transport for everyone, at least in the short term for people with low incomes, children and young people, students and trainees.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - The frequency of the lines must be increased where staff and/or track capacity allow. Especially in the evenings, at night, early in the morning and at weekends, public transport must also be the best possible means of mobility for shift workers.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for a free student ticket for public transport, regardless of the income of the parents.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for the implementation of the expansion plans already drawn up for the DSW21 Stadtbahn lines to the south in Hörde and Hacheney and the development of Kirchlinde by the U47. The focus of further expansion plans must be, among other things, the development of large residential areas and workplaces as well as the train stations in the outer districts.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for school streets, which are closed to traffic around schools and daycare centers, to make it possible for children to travel safely on foot or by bike. Parent taxis lead to dangerous situations directly in front of the facilities - clear traffic-calming measures are needed here. Initiatives like "SpoSpiTo," which motivate children to move and be independent, should be expressly supported.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Approval - Not everyone has a mobile phone and emergency situations are particularly stressful, which is why functioning emergency buttons should be available at all train stations and on all tracks.

Traffic lights in Dortmund are to be checked at least once a month:
Approval - Traffic lights must be regularly checked and maintained, for example, to repair the aids for visually impaired people, which are currently only functioning sporadically.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - Safe routes for cycling and walking are central to socially just, climate-friendly mobility. Children, older people and people with disabilities in particular must be able to move around in public spaces without risk. That is why the Left is calling for protected cycle paths, wider pavements, more zebra crossings and traffic-calmed zones with a high quality of life.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Approval - Enough space for public meeting places allows young people in particular to engage in hobbies and sports. Sports fields at schools also offer multiple uses of space for students and the public.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Approval - Sport and leisure activities are essential for relaxation, stress relief and maintaining health. They also provide opportunities for shared experiences and promote social interaction.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Strong Approval - The proximity of an open swimming pool to every citizen is important. Especially for school swimming, easily accessible baths are essential, so that the lessons do not only consist of traveling to and from the pool. Swimming pools as public facilities also promote participation in social life and are a meeting place for a variety of people.

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Strong Approval - Culture unites. Especially in times of right-wing hysteria, it is important to show commonalities and to provide opportunities for celebration and relaxation. The Left therefore calls for the creative scene to be actively supported - also by providing suitable locations.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - Not everyone can afford mobile data, which is why it is important to set up free Wi-Fi independent of shops and restaurants. It also helps with digitalisation and increases the attractiveness of the districts for pedestrians.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - Young people in particular get their information mainly from digital sources. Online offers can help to reach them in a targeted and low-threshold way and thus strengthen mutual understanding.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Approval - Gastronomy should not only take place in the city centre, but also in the outskirts. The rule of proximity and accessibility must apply equally to every citizen.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for socially disadvantaged groups, such as people with low incomes, people with disabilities and young people, to be included in participation procedures. Participation must be possible in a barrier-free, low-threshold and multilingual manner - also digitally and outside of traditional office hours.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - The future of Dortmund belongs to the youth. Therefore, they should also have the opportunity to actively shape their city of tomorrow. Young people must be systematically included in urban development projects such as parks, playgrounds or new buildings - through participation procedures, youth councils or digital platforms.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - Education is decisive for integration, cultural participation and the perception of political rights. Therefore, education policy must focus more on promoting media literacy and political education in order to counteract disinformation, social division and polarisation.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - The city administration must make its offers and structures more inclusive and at the same time give impetus in the private sector in order to create better conditions for inclusion there as well.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Approval - On the free housing market, trainees can hardly find affordable accommodation. Trainees should have the right to live inexpensively, just like students. This will also increase location flexibility and equal opportunities, as well as reduce dropouts.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Strong Approval - Housing is a human right. The Left is calling for Dortmund to increase the social housing quota to 70% and to create permanent social bonds. Only by better equipping the housing supervisory authority can we take a consistent approach to empty properties and rent gouging.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - Only 5% of Dortmund's playgrounds are barrier-free. Therefore, particular attention must be paid to inclusion in playgrounds, especially in the outer districts. The Left Party is calling for self-managed spaces and youth centres to be strengthened and for appropriate offers to receive sufficient personnel and material resources with more structural and less project funding.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Strong Approval - The Left is committed to ensuring that civil society groups, youth initiatives and clubs can use their own, easily accessible spaces - whether for meetings, rehearsals, events or advice. The provision of such spaces is a central contribution to cultural and social diversity in Dortmund.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for better financial support for the chronically underfunded "social city" action plan. In order to improve living conditions in the particularly impoverished districts of the city, Dortmund should specifically acquire funding from the federal and state governments. This also includes political pressure for an old debt settlement, so that municipal investments in social infrastructure are even possible.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for administrative documents to be available in principle in easy or simple language, in multiple languages and in Braille.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - Just as important as the number is the emptying interval, which must be adapted to the actual needs of the people. Contamination in public spaces must be quickly removed. The Left also demands that free bulky waste collection services be carried out at regular intervals to prevent wild rubbish dumps in residential areas, but also in nature and the environment.

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - Especially in the summer and for citizens affected by poverty, drinking fountains often offer the only possibility of adequate supply of drinking water. These offers must be designed to be barrier-free and should also be signposted for better discoverability.

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for a significant increase in the number of trees on streets and public squares. A canopy of leaves cools the streets and provides fresh air. In addition, at least three replacement trees should be planted when trees are cut down in the street.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - The enormous potential of solar energy, which is mainly offered by the roofs of urban buildings and municipal facilities, must be exploited quickly and comprehensively. Furthermore, the Left Party also calls for the expansion of PV on private roofs to be driven forward, as well as for smaller balcony power plants to be promoted again in a targeted manner, in order to also enable tenants to participate in the energy transition.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for more free and round-the-clock accessible public toilets in central locations in the city centre as well as in all districts.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Strong Approval - The Left will use its function in local committees to publicly name police violence against anti-fascists as well as any form of state support for racists, neo-Nazis and racist politics. It also advocates that public administration employees be sensitized to a prejudice-free and anti-racist approach to all residents.

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - Safe spaces and offers are important in order to create a prejudice-free space for queer youth to get to know their peers. The Left is also calling for queer sports groups to be supported and for safe spaces to be created for queer homeless people.

Drop-in centres are to be set up in every district for gay youths:
Strong Approval - Despite formal gender equality, women and queer people - especially children and young people - are still exposed to numerous forms of discrimination, often even in their own family environment. The Left is therefore calling for more safe spaces and retreats to be established.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - Queer children and young people experience discrimination, exclusion and bullying more frequently. Training helps to reduce prejudices and promote a respectful, open climate in which all young people feel accepted and safe.

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - In this context, the Left is also calling for the barrier-free reconstruction or construction of schools, as well as the hiring of significantly more teachers, in order to enable inclusive teaching for children with support needs.

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - There is still a lack of sports halls in Dortmund that are barrier-free and thus suitable for people with disabilities, even though this should already be standard in new buildings. The Left is calling for a greater focus on the renovation of older halls and sports facilities.

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for the preservation and expansion of free holiday activities and low-cost holiday camps, which must be designed to be accessible to all children and young people.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has criticised Germany several times because the sheltered workshop system is not geared enough towards inclusive employment. The Left is calling for the abolition of these exploitative businesses and instead for the integration of people into the regular job market, as well as inclusive consultations at schools.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Approval - Children with special support needs must not be excluded from or during trips in order to enable equal participation. Complex bureaucracy must not be a reason for exclusion.



Party 4

All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Approval - We want to reduce parent taxis by making school routes and school streets safer.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - Tram facilities and train stations are perceived by many people as spaces of fear. It is an enormously important concern for us to strengthen the sense of security of the passengers. That is why we are advocating that where there is a need for improvement in terms of safety, this should be rectified. At present, for example, we see a need for improvement in the area of the Hörde train station and the tram facilities there. Of course, easily accessible emergency call boxes must be available everywhere. However, where necessary, we also want to make improvements in the area of video surveillance in order to prevent criminal offences.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - We support digital platforms such as "LernDort" and want to expand their offerings.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Approval - The opening of a restaurant is always a business decision, not a political one. Politics can only set favourable framework conditions in which the restaurant industry can develop. We will ensure that this happens.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - We are committed to youth parliaments and other participation formats for young people.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:

Strong Approval - We promote digital offers for political education and administration.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Approval - We want people with disabilities to be able to use their talents and abilities as best as possible in the city's businesses and private employers. The participation of people with disabilities in working life is an important part of a solidary urban society. That is why we are committed to ensuring that all businesses, especially the city administration and its companies, meet the legal requirements for the employment of people with disabilities and, where possible, go beyond them. In addition, we want to remove barriers and design working conditions in such a way that people with disabilities can integrate their individual abilities well. "

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Strong Approval - We have advocated for apprentice housing, which has resulted in the "DOzubi plus" project of the economic development agency.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - We want to create a diverse range of offers for young people in all districts of the city.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Approval - We are focusing on the use of existing buildings for clubs and groups, instead of new additional rooms.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - We want to implement the application and use of subsidies by the city consistently and efficiently.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:

Strong Approval - We want to install more photovoltaic systems on municipal buildings.

In particular, the situation at our schools must be improved soon.

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Strong Approval - We want passengers in the Dortmund city railways to feel safe at all times. That is why we expect DSW21 to ensure that security personnel are present in such a way that passengers can travel with a good and safe feeling, especially during the night hours.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Strong Approval - We expect the employees of the Municipal Order Service to carry out their work free of discrimination of any kind and to be trained and prepared accordingly.

Strong Approval - We are happy to work with the municipal youth office to consider how to expand inclusive holiday offers for children and young people with disabilities or special support needs.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - All young people who are about to enter the world of work are looking for guidance, which is provided by the Federal Employment Agency, including specifically for young people with disabilities.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - We have long been advocating that as many administrative services as possible should be available digitally, easy and convenient to complete. This also applies to the application for services for participation. And if it is complicated in an individual case, questions should be able to be clarified online without a time-consuming visit to the authorities by contacting the "virtual citizen offices" from home.



Party 5

All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - School is more than just lessons. For us Greens, schools are central living spaces. This includes modern school buildings that invite you to learn and healthy, good food for everyone – regardless of the parents’ financial situation. And this includes flexible spaces where individual and group learning is possible. We want schools where every child can develop their potential, no matter where they come from.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - Education should be independent of the parents' wallet! That is why we clearly stand for free educational offers and school materials. We will provide (digital) textbooks for all students free of charge.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund – also in writing:
Strong Approval - The transition from school to work or voluntary service often decides how young people find their place in society. We Greens are committed to ensuring that no young person is left alone on this path. That is why we have strengthened existing counselling services in Dortmund and are committed to comprehensive, reliable support. We want all students to be informed early and specifically about their options – whether it is vocational training, university or voluntary service. Career orientation must not be a privilege, but must be part of a fair education policy. Our goal: real prospects for all.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Strong Approval - Leisure time is more than just a way to pass the time – it is the key to participation and cohesion. We Greens are committed to ensuring that all children and young people in Dortmund have access to the diverse range of activities in their city – regardless of their background, financial situation or language.
That is why we demand: Information about sports, cultural and leisure activities must be brought directly into schools – in a way that is easy to understand, low-threshold and regular. Because those who know what is possible can take part.
Diversity must be experienced, on the football pitch, in the youth centre, in the theatre group. We want Dortmund’s leisure landscape to be as diverse as its society. And we ensure that these activities are developed with genuine youth participation. Only in this way can a city be created in which everyone belongs.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - We want clean and attractive learning environments and we are committed to maintaining well-kept and safe school environments.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - No one should have to learn on an empty stomach. That is why we, the Greens in Dortmund, have partially brought about and actively supported free breakfast offers at primary schools. But that is not enough. We want all students to receive a good, warm lunch – free of charge, healthy, organic and from the region. This requires enough and well-equipped canteens at all schools with full-day care.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Strong Approval - Learning locations such as libraries have been strengthened and expanded in the vicinity of residential areas, for example with the Nordstadtbibliothek.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Strong Approval - We have specifically promoted public learning locations such as libraries.

Our libraries play an important role in Dortmund. Not only can all people have access to literature through them, but their events, courses and learning locations are indispensable for education and also for social cohesion in our city.

Therefore, we will
    • promote libraries and bookshops close to home and the expansion in other parts of the city and finance and implement necessary renovations.
    • expand the offer of open quiet and learning locations in municipal libraries
    • equip the planned district library in Nordstadt well, for example with multilingual books, and maintain all existing district libraries.
    • enable every primary school class in Nordstadt to visit the new district library and issue a library card to each child
    • support the libraries in their adaptation to digital and new requirements.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - School social work was secured and expanded by GREEN motions.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Strong Approval - Mental health projects such as "Seelenpflaster" have been promoted.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Strong Approval - The metropolradruhr offer was significantly expanded at the request of the GREENS. In particular, cargo bikes and additional stations were added.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Strong Approval - We will work together with bike rental providers like metropolradruhr to ensure that even more stations with more bikes are set up. We have also already supported more than 1,000 bike parking spaces and other infrastructure in the last 5 years.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - We Greens are consistently committed to safe and well-developed cycle paths. We have created numerous new cycle paths, closed gaps, designated cycle streets and implemented measures for traffic safety – for example, through a 30 km/h speed limit, safe crossings and better separation of cycle and car traffic. We continue to demand a comprehensive expansion of safe, continuous and motorised cycle paths. The goal is a real “cycling city of Dortmund”, in which children, senior citizens and inexperienced people can move around on their bikes without fear.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval - Mobility should not be a question of money. We, the Greens, want all school children in Dortmund to be able to travel for free on buses and trains – with a free Germany School Ticket. Because anyone who wants to go to school, to play sports or to visit friends should be able to do so easily and safely, regardless of their parents’ income. At the same time, we are fighting for an affordable social ticket, so that adults with little money can also be mobile and independent. Fair mobility is a question of participation and the future.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - Some timetable adjustments and new lines have already been decided. 

Buses transport thousands of Dortmunders every day on short and long routes through Dortmund. For us, it is clear: the journey with buses and trains must be comfortable. Bus traffic must serve the everyday routes of the people. And the bus must arrive on time. 

For this, we will, among other things

    • generally grant buses automatic priority at traffic lights (priority switching). 
    • set up dedicated bus lanes on core routes and, if possible. 
    • re-plan important traffic axes and set up a bicycle and bus lane as well as a speed limit of 30 km/h.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Strong Approval - We want to offer the DeutschlandTicket Schule free of charge to all students.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Strong Approval - We want a well-developed and modern public transport system. Fewer cars mean less noise, better air and more space in our city. An attractive local transport system makes life easier, fairer and more climate-friendly. That is why we are committed to ensuring that buses and trains are on time, clean and affordable – and that everyone in Dortmund can get to their destination quickly.

However, the lives of many Dortmund residents do not end at the city limits. Wherever possible, we want to advocate for the city of Dortmund to expand the network and increase the frequency of services in discussions with the VRR, Deutsche Bahn and other companies.

We will, among other things,
    • ensure that the Stadtbahn connects the district of Kirchlinde
    • extend the U44 to Westfalenhütte
    • work to relocate stops where a better transfer to the Dortmund local transport system or better access to important destinations can be achieved (e.g. Dortmund Tierpark, Aplerbeck Süd, Barop S) and to use potentials for additional access to the stops (e.g. a rear exit at Bf Hör

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Strong Approval - Students should be able to get to school safely – on foot, by bike or scooter. This requires streets that belong to them. We Greens have therefore initiated and actively supported the introduction of car-free school streets in Dortmund.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - Emergency call systems have already been installed at some of the city rail stops. In the context of the barrier-free reconstruction, safety at stops will also be addressed in the future.

Traffic lights in Dortmund are to be checked at least once a month:
Strong Approval - We have launched a “GREEN WAVE” for cycling. 28 traffic lights have been converted so far and more will follow. The system will also be extended to pedestrians, so that people with mobility impairments will also be able to cross the road safely in the future.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - We are committed to a city in which all people can move safely and freely – whether on foot, in a wheelchair or with a stroller. A city in which barrier-free access is not a special case, but a matter of course. A city that puts people at the center. The transportation revolution also means making pedestrian traffic safer and more attractive. The design of our streets must take into account the weakest road users, so that everyone feels equally safe. Our vision is clear: a city in which everyone can reach their destination on foot. A city that does not exclude anyone. For this reason, the goal must be to create more safety for pedestrians in every re-planning and new planning of a street.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Strong Approval - Movement needs space – and that for everyone. We Greens demand that the sports facilities at our schools are finally modernised and expanded. Because dilapidated gyms and broken down playing fields not only hinder physical education, but also enthusiasm for movement.

For us, it is clear: every sports facility must be barrier-free. All children and young people – with and without disabilities – should be able to play sports without encountering obstacles.

Good sports facilities are investments in health, community and participation.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Strong Approval - We are committed to an inclusive, diverse sports landscape that leaves no one out. Many people in Dortmund use the parks to engage in sports and relax. We see this as an opportunity to make our city even better, greener and healthier.

Therefore, we will
    • create sports facilities for all age groups from children to seniors in public spaces, for example fitness courses, table tennis tables, calisthenics facilities, basketball courts, ball courts, skate parks and boules tracks.
    • introduce a "Sport im Park" program based on the Düsseldorf model for all Dortmund residents, which offers non-binding and free sports meetups for untrained and sporty people of all age groups in parks.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Strong Approval - We want all children to be able to learn to swim and will make it easier to access swimming lessons. By re-municipalising and taking over the 8 swimming pools of the Sportwelt, we want to ensure that the pools in Dortmund's districts are preserved.

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Approval - Dortmund should be lively, safe and diverse even at night. We Greens stand for a nightlife that makes culture, encounters and freedom possible – and we have already achieved a lot: the curfew has been abolished, and a night mayor has been appointed.

But that is just the beginning. We want to further develop Dortmund's nightlife – creatively, in a way that is appropriate for a big city and open to everyone. This includes a club fund to support new spaces and ideas, as well as a friendly review of municipal land for cultural night-time events.

A diverse nightlife is part of a modern city – and an expression of lived freedom.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - Digitalisation is an opportunity that must be shaped responsibly by politicians, so that all people can equally benefit from the positive aspects. For us, the focus is on a future-proof digital infrastructure, free and equal access to the network for all, as well as the protection of our privacy and our personal data, for example through the highest IT security standards.

Therefore, we will, among other things,
    • further expand the digital infrastructure in Dortmund by promoting the comprehensive expansion of broadband Internet and fast mobile networks to enable companies and citizens to access modern technologies from all parts of Dortmund.
    • expand the Dortmund app as an easy-to-use central point of contact for all citizens for citizen service appointments, all applications (including for social benefits), booking systems and reporting defects (defective lighting, illegal waste collections, incorrectly parked vehicles, etc.).
    • expand free internet throughout the inner city and district centres, as well as in all public buildings and public transport, and connect all areas of the Smart City to the Dortmund app.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - Young people have a voice – and it should be heard. We Greens want the city of Dortmund to finally become more youth-oriented in its communication. That is why we are advocating for our own youth editorial team to help shape the city’s social media channels.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Approval - Vibrant cities need space for people, not for metal. That is why the GREENS have been campaigning for years to allow outdoor dining on public spaces – even where cars are currently parked.

In 2022, our proposal was rejected by the SPD, CDU, FDP and the Left. But we didn't give up. In 2024, there was a change of heart: under our pressure, the city is finally allowing parking spaces to be made available for outdoor dining.

This shows that persistent GREEN commitment works – for a better quality of life, more joy of life and more space for social interaction.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - We Greens have been fighting for years to make participation in Dortmund more inclusive, barrier-free and attractive for all groups. Since 2020, our work has introduced new participation formats such as digital tools, open participation procedures and the establishment of the Youth Commission - with a special focus on accessibility for young people, people with disabilities and marginalized groups. In the future, participation is to be systematically made more accessible, especially for people with language barriers, low education or experiences of discrimination. For this, the Greens are calling for multilingual information, simple language, digital and analog access as well as target group-specific formats.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - We have decided to develop a participation concept for young people.

We want young people in Dortmund to be able to have a say and help shape all decisions that affect them - whether in school, in clubs or in town planning. Young people know their needs best, which is why they are experts in their own interests. We do not want to shape Dortmund for children and young people, but with them.

We want to create a municipal fund for creative projects at schools and youth facilities.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - We don’t just want to explain things, we want to actively involve young people in political contexts. Young people should explain to the city what politics should look like.
As the GREENS, we have specifically used and promoted digital formats in the 2020–2025 council period to make political education and participation accessible to young people. The introduction of digital participation tools, online platforms for youth projects, and media support for political processes are examples. School projects, digital workshops, and youth events were also supported to spark political interest.
In the future, we will continue to expand these offers: political education should be designed digitally, interactively, and in a way that is tailored to the target group – for example, through apps, digital participation spaces, and social media formats. The goal is to reach young people where they are – online – and to offer them simple ways to get involved and help shape things.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - We have demanded an increase in the inclusion quota in the city, because it has been declining for years. We want the city to try out its own inclusion business and significantly increase the number of training places for young people with disabilities.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Strong Approval - Trainees need not only good companies, but also affordable housing. We Greens have therefore initiated and actively supported a trainee housing project in Dortmund – because training should not fail due to rent.

Our goal is clear: Dortmund should be an attractive training location. For this, we want to further develop and expand the trainee housing as a safe, affordable place to live and learn.

Those who decide on an apprenticeship deserve support and good conditions from the start.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Strong Approval - We have decided on a 30% quota for social housing.

Housing is a basic right. That is why we are committed to ensuring that all people in Dortmund can find affordable housing and do not have to worry about losing their homes. We must especially support those who, for various reasons, have difficulty finding a place on the general housing market. Our goal is that rent should not exceed 30% of available income.

We will expand the quota for social housing to 40% for new development plans and will additionally offer at least 10% of the homes in each new development area in the so-called price-capped segment, i.e. with square meter prices between social rent and asking rent, which is secured by a town planning agreement.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - To make Dortmund an attractive city for young people, we will:
 
• Establish and upgrade more self-managed youth centres in all districts of the city together with young people
• Modernise existing youth leisure facilities and provide them with up-to-date equipment
• Create more alcohol-free places where young people can spend time together in groups in the evenings
• Ensure open spaces and areas in every district of the city to promote creative, sporting and musical activities, including rehearsal rooms for young bands.
• Promote synergies in the use of space by encouraging schools, kindergartens, churches, local community centres, etc. to make their spaces available to clubs, youth groups, initiatives, etc.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Strong Approval - Urban spaces belong to everyone – not just a few. We Greens are committed to making access to public spaces and urban infrastructure easier, more transparent and fairer. Whether for youth groups, initiatives or cultural projects: those who show commitment should not be held back by bureaucracy or hurdles. Spaces must be able to be used – without bureaucracy and fairly. After all, a lively city needs space for ideas.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - Good ideas need resources. That is why we, the GREENS, are committed to ensuring that Dortmund continues to successfully apply for funding in the future – for social projects, climate protection, education, culture and youth.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Strong Approval - Multilingual and simple communication is already being strengthened. On our initiative, the city's website can now be automatically translated into other languages.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - We are producing more and more waste in Dortmund and are thereby wasting valuable resources. We want to promote a change in thinking and create the conditions for products to be used longer and more often, repaired, used in parts or have their components recycled. At the same time, we want to reduce the amount of waste that is illegally disposed of in the city or in nature. We want to do the following:
    • Make deposit systems for coffee-to-go cups mandatory in Dortmund.
    • Work completely with reusable systems at large events in the city.
    • Support the introduction of reusable systems at the weekly markets, the Christmas market, other markets and fairs in the city and promote them through relief from garbage fees.
    • Continue to demand the introduction of a municipal packaging tax according to the Tübingen model, which makes the switch to reusable systems attractive for the catering industry.
    • Strive for the establishment of a second-hand goods store with an attached repair café or an upcycling workshop.
    • Promote exchange markets for used products such as clothing, furnishings,

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - We have initiated drinking water offers at schools.

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - Trees bind CO2 and fine dust in the air, strengthen the heat resistance of the city through shade and natural coolness, ensure the desegregation of areas, offer nesting places for birds and enhance the city and landscape image. 

We will 
    • identify needs for improving the stock of street trees and street greenery and in particular make proposals for streets without any greenery in residential areas. 
    • replant dead trees on existing tree islands, replant empty tree islands and set up new tree islands in order to achieve the already agreed target of an additional 1000 trees. 
    • select location-appropriate and climate-resistant trees 
    • preserve and maintain old and significant city trees. 
    • take into account the planting of trees when designing new streets. 
    • plant a Tiny Forest (Mikrowald) on a remaining area in a densely populated residential or commercial area as a model experiment for a climate adaptation measure.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - The expansion of solar power on roofs has started and the obligation for new urban buildings has been introduced.

For the energy transition, we need the expansion of renewable energy. We need to use the municipal opportunities to advise and promote and to create the framework conditions and thus to lead by example. For this we will

• as quickly as possible, install photovoltaic systems on all suitable municipal roofs and facades, i.e. on administrative buildings, schools, childcare facilities, sports halls, event venues or hospitals.
• cover parking spaces, which cannot be built on elsewhere, with solar systems and green roofs, in order to use the areas for energy generation and for E-charging stations and at the same time create a roof.
• advise operators of agricultural land on the use of agri-PV, i.e. photovoltaic systems over the areas, and promote implementation.
• concentrate on solar power plants on open spaces, such as landfills, contaminated land, conversion or fallow land as well as along infrastructure axes.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - Access to a clean, safe toilet is a basic need and a matter of dignity. We Greens have put the issue of public toilets on the agenda time and again because it plays a big role in the lives of many people.

We demand: More barrier-free, free and 24-hour toilets must be created in public buildings and public spaces – clean, safe and usable for all genders.

An inclusive city thinks of everyone, even where it is often overlooked.

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Approval - We advocate a security concept that takes the diversity of Dortmund seriously. A city is safe when everyone feels safe in it, regardless of where they come from, how they look or how they live. Security does not begin with blue lights, but with good lighting, accessible contact persons, respectful behavior and reliable support in everyday life. This requires a police force that works close to the citizens and transparently, an order service that helps and supports sensitively, and municipal structures that offer protection without stigmatizing. It needs safe spaces as well as trust, accessibility as well as a clear stance against violence.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Strong Approval - Discrimination must not be tolerated in any authority. That is why we Greens want to make anti-discrimination training mandatory for all employees. Only in this way can we reduce prejudices and ensure a respectful and fair administration.

We are also pushing for the establishment of an anti-discrimination staff unit in the administration. This unit should coordinate anti-racist measures and serve as a central point of contact for those affected.

In addition, we are strengthening our initiative for further training in dealing with people in exceptional psychological situations. This will create more awareness, competence and protection - for all those who are dependent on support.

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - We will continue to support safe spaces such as the Sunrise Youth Centre and the queer group of the Forum Jugend. As called for in the LSBTIQ action plan we initiated, we want to strengthen and qualify youth clubs in every district of the city to be open drop-in centres for queer youth.

Our vision is a city where everyone can live without fear of discrimination, with equal opportunities and the freedom to develop individually. Racism, antisemitism, queerphobia and other forms of discrimination have no place in Dortmund.

We are fighting for a city where queer people not only live safely, but can also actively participate and develop. For this, safe spaces must be expanded, political structures strengthened and queer organisations specifically supported. It is particularly important to us to focus on LSBTIQ* youth, who are often confronted with social pressure and prejudices in their search for identity. That is why we will take specific measures to further promote equality, participation and acceptance of LSBTIQ* people in Dortmund.

We will permanently support the SCHLAU project to conduct workshops in

Drop-in centres are to be set up in every district for gay youths:
Strong Approval - We will continue to implement and develop the LSBTIQ action plan that we initiated against the discrimination of LSBTIQ* people. We will push forward the demand for contact points in all districts by qualifying existing youth clubs and centres. It is important to us that all youth facilities are able to be prepared for the concerns of queer youth. We will continue to provide financial and structural support to SLADO and other LSBTIQ* initiatives and queer associations that make an important contribution to the acceptance and support of LSBTIQ* people, but are dependent on voluntary work and require sustainable support.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - We want to offer training for teachers on dealing with diversity and preventing discrimination. To this end, we want to continue to promote and strengthen the SCHLAU project in order to also reach employees in schools and youth facilities.

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - We, the Greens, are committed to designing school from the child’s perspective and to promoting all students in Dortmund in the best possible way, so that no one is left behind. Inclusion and individual support must not just be buzzwords, but must become a lived reality in everyday school life. We want a school system that is oriented towards the needs of children and not vice versa.

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - Youth and leisure facilities must be inclusive and accessible to all, i.e. without barriers.

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Strong Approval - Holiday offers must be open and accessible to everyone. We have worked to ensure that this requirement is met in the city's holiday offers.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - We Greens have already significantly strengthened the transition from school to work, and we will consistently continue on this path. Because every young person deserves a real chance for a successful start to working life.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - With our budget proposals, we have explicitly supported the visit of extra-curricular learning locations with financial resources. Our goal is that all young people can participate in the offers during the school trip free of charge.

We have also replaced the Dortmund Pass with the Dortmund Card and have thus enabled more families to use municipal offers free of charge or at a reduced price.

We want to counteract child and youth poverty by improving early childhood support and expanding care offers, especially in disadvantaged districts, as well as creating free sports offers and supporting the necessary equipment.

We will ensure that the funds for education and participation are more easily and less bureaucratically accessible.

Approval - 

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:

Strong Approval - 

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Strong Approval -

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Approval - 

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Approval - Affordable housing is a basic right. As an alliance for diversity and tolerance, we are campaigning for stricter requirements in social housing – so that living in Dortmund remains possible for everyone.

The basic tax in Dortmund is to rise.:
Approval - A moderate increase in the property tax can help to finance important social and educational measures in Dortmund. As an alliance for diversity and tolerance, we support this - if the relief for tenants is also taken into account.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Approval - 

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:

Party 7

All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - 

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Strong Approval - 

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - 

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Approval - 

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Approval - We are in favour of expansion based on demand, i.e. expansion when actual use is proven.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Approval - 

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Approval - The bottleneck here is less the money than the lack of drivers, and while we are in favour of expanding this, it must be clear that this can only be done gradually - as was the case recently with the extended operating hours of the Stadtbahn at night.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Approval - There are important light rail expansion projects. However, these require a very long lead time. We see short-term solutions for connecting the outer city districts more in better bus connections and in ride sharing, i.e. digitally coordinated shared taxis.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Approval - 

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - 

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - Es is necessary to invest more in pedestrian traffic. The FDP has already submitted corresponding applications in the last election period.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - 

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Approval - 

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Strong Approval - The FDP is advocating, among other things, the abolition of special usage fees for outdoor catering, which would reduce the costs for catering businesses.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - 

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Approval - At least when it comes to urban construction projects, we want to involve young people through a youth parliament, similar to the senior citizens' council.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - 

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:

Strong Approval - 

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Approval - 

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - 

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - 

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Approval - We strongly support the basic idea. This is an important measure for climate adaptation. However, this will not be feasible everywhere, as certain uses (Christmas markets, concerts, etc.) would otherwise have to be restricted.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Approval - To this end, the FDP in the council in the last election period initiated the examination of the specific structural possibilities. The installation should take place within the scope of the financial possibilities. However, this should not be at the expense of the renovation of classrooms, roofs or toilet facilities in schools.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - 

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Approval - We want to expand the visible security service in the subways. However, realistically, implementation in every single subway is not feasible in terms of personnel.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Approval - 

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - 

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - 

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - 

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Approval - 

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - 

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - 



Party 8

All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Approval - A minimum standard is to be achieved in all schools and classrooms. Schools may plan and implement more extensive specific equipment.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - What else? The Monday morning state of a schoolyard decides the learning atmosphere. The arrival in the school week determines the social structure of the rest of the week.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - Definitely! Schools are more or less successfully putting together their own solutions, e.g. with the OGS sponsorship, sponsoring, BuT variants...  --> All Murks! Give the kiddies something to eat, then we'll see further.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Approval - Here too, the need in the respective district should be examined beforehand. Public learning locations should be able to reflect the entire spectrum of education - from literacy to university studies.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - Definitely. Teachers cannot possibly pick up all the baggage that young people carry with them from a very early age in teaching situations. This is not only true for socially disadvantaged families! In principle, this is a minimum requirement that should also be addressed to the state government.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Approval - Going out, team building, the good old fresh air,... experiences instead of pure teaching content. That makes sense when it comes to raising responsible and self-determined people. Whether this can be achieved by the municipality alone is questionable.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Approval - A well thought-out network of parking and pick-up points makes the overall offer meaningful.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - In the interest of ALL road users: cycle paths are either done properly or not at all! "Curb hopping" and chaotic traffic light sequences are the last thing we need in Dortmund.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval - Other cities have shown the way: lowering prices leads to better occupancy rates and significantly fewer losses than most people fear. In our city, unfortunately, we can only watch as ticket prices rise.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - An attractive timetable and coverage in public transport must become a core element of Dortmund's transport policy. Give me a chance to use public transport in everyday life, and I'll gladly give up my car.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Approval - Uncomplicated mobility within the city area leads to orientation and thus also contributes significantly to the personal connection to "my city".

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Strong Approval - Of course! By the way: the world does not end at the city limits! Ask in Wasserkurl, Buchholz, Groppenbruch etc.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - Security in public spaces MUST be increased.

The use of flashing lights is to be avoided to increase traffic safety:
Approval - You can't just do without these annoying things. But if they are only geared towards maximum yield with a trapper's instinct, then this has nothing to do with traffic safety and should be stopped.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Approval - Emphasis on "safety" for all involved. Pedestrians are wrongly at the bottom of the safety chain.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Approval - A concept can show the needs and possibilities for this, and this should also include the possibility of ball courts.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Approval - First of all, the Herculean task of renovating Dortmund's baths needs to be tackled. If all the existing baths were in a usable condition, we would already be well equipped. What we really need is a family leisure bath.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - Positive effects on the urban community are inevitable, for example, for attractiveness and quality of life. In the best sense, an investment in the future of our city.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Strong Approval - Economic resilience, cityscape, quality of life, neighborhood meeting places, urban culture.... I could go on and on...

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - Participation opportunities must be made available to citizens. Not just advisory boards and remote administrative consultation hours. However, the city society must take initiative and get a grip on its own nose --> People, do something!

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - What else?

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Approval - So, self-participation. Politics does not happen by itself. It is made by people - and in the best case, for people.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Approval - Housing planning in Dortmund is an absolute KEY ISSUE for our future as a functioning city! No concept can be so far-fetched that one does not at least have to think about it. Think out of the box!

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - Too little is still being done here.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Approval - When selecting foreign languages, discrimination should be avoided. Who selects the languages? Honestly: in times of Google Translate, this should not be a problem.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - 

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - 

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - 

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - 

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - 

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Strong Approval - 

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Approval - 

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - You don't have to reinvent the wheel. You just have to make existing public facilities more aware.

Drop-in centres are to be set up in every district for gay youths:
Strong Approval - Acceptance of our diverse society begins - and unfortunately ends - in every single head. Contact points are necessary; however, they do not solve the fundamental problem.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - 

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - That is already law!

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - That is already law!

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - This task goes far beyond Dortmund's borders. There are numerous rehabilitation offers from the employment agency or job center, but unfortunately they are still too bureaucratic.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - I'm for it!



Party 9

All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - Equal opportunities in education begin with the equipment of schools.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - The question of whether a book should be purchased should not depend on the income of the parents.

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Strong Approval - In individual cases, school buses may be unnecessary, for example in the case of very compact catchment areas or good tram connections. But in principle, every school should have a school bus. The widespread use of school buses is made possible by better coordinated school start times.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund – also in writing:
Strong Approval - Young people are thinking about their future careers. Many of them lack an overview of their options. At the same time, many training places remain unfilled. The city must take action.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Strong Approval - There are many offers that are not used very much because they are not well enough known. This is just as bad for the children and young people as it is for the clubs and organisations.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - The condition of many outdoor areas is alarming and in some cases even dangerous. This must change.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - For many children in Dortmund, a midday meal is unfortunately not a given. This is to change. In the long term, most schools are to be equipped with their own school kitchens.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Strong Approval - Where there are no free learning and education offers, such offers must be created urgently.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Strong Approval - The tasks of libraries are different today than in the past, but they remain important public places of learning. We need more of these offers, also as an extension of schools.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - The sooner socially conspicuous behaviour and psychological problems are recognised and treated, the more sustainable the help will be. This requires short distances and fixed contact persons.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Strong Approval - Up to now, there are far too few preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic offers for young people.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Strong Approval - The use of rental bicycles should be possible with the ticket for bus and train. This ticket should be free for young people.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Strong Approval - Rental bikes are only interesting if they are close enough to the starting point and can be parked at the destination, which is why a dense network of bike parking spaces is required.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - White lines or red paint alone do not make cycle paths safe. Cycle paths must be wide enough and, if possible, physically separated from the road.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval - The hurdle for using bus and train must be lowered as much as possible.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - Bus lines are only useful if the buses run frequently enough to be a real alternative to the car.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Strong Approval - If children and young people can travel by bus and train at any time and without any problems, they will do so much more often as adults.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Strong Approval - In particular, existing tram lines are to be extended into the outer areas.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Strong Approval - Parent taxis exacerbate the problem they are trying to combat, because the fear of the dangers of road traffic means that more children are taken to school by car, which increases the danger for everyone else.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - Emergency buttons must be standard equipment in all train stations.

Traffic lights in Dortmund are to be checked at least once a month:
Strong Approval - Where traffic lights cannot be replaced by roundabouts or zebra crossings, traffic lights should permanently monitor their condition electronically and report it. Until this works across the board, regular checks must take place.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - Safe routes are the basic prerequisite for more people to walk or cycle.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Strong Approval - Multi-purpose sports grounds are an important leisure-time facility even outside school hours. Since they can be of different sizes and can be used for many different sports, they should be planned for all school locations.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Strong Approval - Sports boxes are a good offer to make it easier for people to exercise outdoors.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Strong Approval - The proportion of people who can swim is decreasing, and we need to counteract this by creating widespread opportunities to learn how to swim. In addition, swimming is a healthy leisure activity that we want to promote.

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Strong Approval - There are too few clubs and discos in Dortmund to reflect the variety of all cultures, styles and tastes. In order for new clubs to be able to settle, the city must offer suitable areas to interested operators.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - A free-to-use WLAN network must be part of the basic supply in the central squares of the city, even outside the city centre.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - Good leisure and educational offers are only useful if they are known. An online portal that presents these offers completely, but in an orderly manner, is long overdue.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Strong Approval - Hospitality is an important part of public life and is hugely important for vibrant neighbourhood centres.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - Anyone who lives here must be able to contribute. This applies in particular to all issues and projects that affect one's own neighbourhood, but also the whole city. No one should be excluded.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - Young people must be given the same opportunity to participate in planning processes as older people. To achieve this, they must be specifically addressed and suitable formats for dialogue must be chosen.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - Political education is enormously important in times of far-reaching disinformation. The city must make its contribution so that young people know how politics works locally and how they can get involved themselves. Digital offers are particularly effective in reaching young people.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - Municipal undertakings can and should take on special responsibility and lead by example, including in relation to the employment of people with disabilities.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Strong Approval - Trainees in particular, with their low incomes, need accommodation that they can afford. Hostels have established themselves in some areas, for example in hospitals.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Strong Approval - The proportion of publicly funded construction is quite obviously too low to guarantee a roof over the heads of all people in Dortmund.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - Offers for young people must be available across the board.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Approval - Many clubs already have their own rooms or require special equipment. Nevertheless, the city should expand the offer of usable rooms for clubs. However, Nazis should stay at home.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - Without funding, nothing can be done with social measures anymore. Every euro counts.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Strong Approval - German is a difficult language and it takes a long time to learn it, which is why it is important to provide information in all relevant languages.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - The degree of contamination of the pavements also depends on the insufficient number of public litter bins.

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - There are only very few drinking fountains in Dortmund. This is to change.

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - Especially in large spaces, trees can greatly increase the quality of the environment.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - Solar installations must become a standard part of construction.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - There are too few public toilets in Dortmund. That has to change.

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
