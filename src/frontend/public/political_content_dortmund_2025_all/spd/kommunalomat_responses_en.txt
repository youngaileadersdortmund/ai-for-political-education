All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - We stand for record investments in school construction, so that all children and young people have the best standard everywhere.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - We want to make all education free.

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Strong Approval - This depends primarily on the availability of drivers. Applications to DSW21 are welcome.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund â€“ also in writing:
Strong Approval - With our programme with the economic development agency we are doing something even better: real companies from the neighbourhood are showing careers at schools.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Strong Approval - This is becoming more and more important, because the open day is about the neighbourhood and clubs coming to the schools.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - We will have a special program not only for cleaning but for improving the entire school grounds.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - We want to make the entire education sector free of charge. This includes a healthy lunch in kindergartens and schools.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Strong Approval - We need offers like this in our neighbourhoods, on the ground, and we want to expand this.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Strong Approval - We are currently renovating it and have even launched a completely new additional library. But we need more of these modern learning spaces and we want to finance them.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - That is the direction in which things are moving. The goal must always be that we no longer need it, but at the moment it is necessary.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Approval - For example, we have taken new paths with the loneliness department as the first city in Germany, because we have to face new challenges in a targeted way. No child or young person in Dortmund should be left behind or left alone.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Strong Approval - If you look at other countries, it would be a clever advertising measure, but the providers are not doing this in Germany so far.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Approval - We don't say no to any good provider, but in fact what you see is their offer.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - We are currently building the first closed cycle network in Dortmund, consisting of cycle routes, to open up the entire city. This will then also be safe for everyone, especially for children.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Approval - In Dortmund we invented the social ticket and we are also in favour of price reductions based on the Germany ticket, but we cannot determine this alone. From our point of view, it must become cheaper again.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - We are increasing the pace wherever we can. What is missing? People who drive, applications are welcome.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Strong Approval - We still think that this is the right thing to do and we are pushing for a majority in the council. It is already cheap in Dortmund, but it can be changed.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Approval - This has already been decided and the expansion is already starting in various places.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Approval - This has been possible for a few months and is already taking place in the first schools - where there is really a problem.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - That is actually the responsibility of Deutsche Bahn, but we also remind them of it regularly.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - That is why we are investing a lot of money, no matter what mode of transport. All routes in Dortmund must be safe, especially for children and young people.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Approval - We are currently in the process of renewing the sports area (gyms and playing fields) at many schools, which goes hand in hand with the many new and renovated schools.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Strong Approval - That is a good idea, which is already being considered in concrete terms by some sports associations. After all, the care of these sites is just as important.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Approval - We have just taken over the sports world and will maintain and renovate all the swimming pools in Dortmund. This structure has proven itself and should not be dismantled (as some would like).

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Strong Approval - This is happening. The challenge is that there are fewer people than before who are supposed to open something. We also have our own club fund, night commissioner and much more to promote the whole scene. This is only available in Dortmund.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - The programme for this is already underway, but it will still be needed until 2029 with the fibre optic expansion that is also needed for this. The goal is maximum coverage.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - We have just had a re-launch of the city's offer, now special portals for different groups are to follow.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Strong Approval - We have the only national gastronomy competition in Germany in Dortmund, where many new restaurants are created every year. But more importantly, prices need to come down. We have always been the only ones in Dortmund to argue for a lower value-added tax.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - We have gained experience here with our new formats, both digital and live. It is important that not only certain groups participate or that certain formats dominate. It is about addressing people, being on the same level and, above all, effectiveness.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - We have already collected positive examples of this in parks and leisure areas, and we want to make this the norm for places for young people.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - That is available, and we have found that you have to do both, digital and live. The digital offerings are getting better and better, but we are working on it.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - This is also a legal obligation.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Strong Approval - We have already started doing this and we want to continue doing it.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Strong Approval - We want to increase the quota for this to 40 percent, but in our opinion the city must continue to build itself. This will relieve the housing market in a very concrete way.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - We want to start a new special programme for the expansion of offers in every neighbourhood. Dortmund has always been characterised by its breadth. This will require significantly more money. And we want to become the youth capital of Europe by 2029.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Strong Approval - We want to build such places of encounter in every neighbourhood.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - The goal should always be that you don't need any subsidies for that, but until then we'll do it. Not blindly, but in a targeted way and we're quite successful at it.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Strong Approval - That is why we need even more languages, which is much easier to do digitally these days. We have learned a lot from the pandemic.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - We have increased cleaning in particularly dirty areas sixfold in some cases in recent years. Because more bins alone does not solve the problem of cleanliness, sometimes it even makes it worse if you put the wrong ones in place.

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - The programme for this started with the municipal utilities last summer and is being continually expanded.

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - This is already being implemented. We have already decided on a so-called master plan for places.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - We started this, and it is often not the city that is failing, but the providers, who often find it too complicated.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - Yes, but unfortunately there are too few free spaces for that.

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Strong Approval - We have founded our own city security service to be able to act better here. But it is not always the sole solution on site, which is why we initiated the Dortmund Guides.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Strong Approval - This is already happening.

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - With the new action plan for LSTBQ+ we want to tackle this in a targeted way. Sunrise must be expanded first.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - This is already happening.

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - What else?

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - This is the law, which is also being implemented step by step.

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Strong Approval - We are currently expanding the offer for all children and yes, that also means we need more inclusive programmes.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - In our view, all people have the right to work and to choose their profession freely.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - That is right and it really needs less bureaucracy from the state and the federal government.
