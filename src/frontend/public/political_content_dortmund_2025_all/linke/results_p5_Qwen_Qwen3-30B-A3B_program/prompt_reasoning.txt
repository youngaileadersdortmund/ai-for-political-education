Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by this political program. Each description needs to be concise, 3-6 words, and returned as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to go through the summary and pick out the key points related to the city's visual aspects. The program talks a lot about housing, public transport, homelessness, public spaces, and environmental issues. 

Looking for visual elements: 

1. **Public Transportation**: The program mentions free public transport, expanding the rail network, and safer cycle paths. So, the visual aspect here could be the expansion of public transit infrastructure, like more buses, trains, or bike lanes. That might translate to "Expanded public transit networks" or something similar.

2. **Housing Policies**: They want more social housing, affordable housing, and to prevent homelessness. Visual aspects here could be the presence of social housing developments or the lack of them. Maybe "Increased social housing construction".

3. **Green Spaces**: There's a mention of transforming asphalt schoolyards into green areas, creating nature reserves, and improving water quality. So, "Enhanced green spaces and parks" could be a point.

4. **Pedestrian-Friendly Areas**: The program talks about pedestrian-unfriendly traffic light sequences and the need for safer streets. So, "Pedestrian-friendly street designs" makes sense.

5. **Public Facilities**: They mention barrier-free public facilities, accessible buildings, and the need for inclusive design. Maybe "Accessible public infrastructure" or "Barrier-free public spaces".

Wait, let me check if these are all covered. The program also mentions things like the "wall becoming a circular promenade" and "cycle paths must be safe". So maybe "Safe cycling infrastructure" instead of pedestrian. Also, the "Cargo Tram network" and "cycle paths" could be part of transport. 

Another point is the "retrofitting public transport" and "barrier-free toilets". Maybe "Inclusive public facilities" instead. Also, the "renatured landscapes" and "green connections" from the IGA 2027. 

Hmm, need to pick the top five. Let me make sure each is a visual aspect. 

1. Expanded public transit networks (buses, trains, bike lanes)
2. Increased social housing construction (new buildings, affordable housing)
3. Enhanced green spaces and parks (more trees, parks, green areas)
4. Pedestrian-friendly street designs (safe walkways, traffic light improvements)
5. Inclusive public facilities (barrier-free, accessible for disabled, etc.)

Alternatively, "Safe cycling infrastructure" instead of pedestrian. But the user said 5, so I need to pick the most impactful. Let me check the original text again for other mentions. 

The "Cargo Tram network" is mentioned, but that's more about transport. The "wall becoming a circular promenade" is a specific visual change. But maybe that's too specific. 

I think the five I have are solid. Let me make sure each is 3-6 words. 

- Expanded public transit networks
- Increased social housing construction
- Enhanced green spaces and parks
- Pedestrian-friendly street designs
- Inclusive public facilities

Yes, each is within the word limit. That should cover the main visual aspects affected by the program.
