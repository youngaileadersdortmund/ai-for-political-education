We fight for an education system that offers all children fair opportunities – from the daycare center to the university.
We want to create spaces in which community is possible, in which diversity is lived and social participation is self-evident.
Our goals for Dortmund's city districts: Promote lively neighborhoods through city centers, meeting places and intercultural offers.
More green, playgrounds and cultural offerings.
Clean cities through regular cleaning and reliable waste disposal.
Safe public spaces - through better lighting and attractive urban design.
Our goal is a city of Dortmund in which culture and leisure time activities are accessible to all – regardless of income, social situation or education.
This also requires good infrastructure, less bureaucracy for associations and targeted investments in neighbouring urban areas.
Free or heavily discounted access to sports and leisure facilities for children, trainees and senior citizens.
Culture for all – through low-cost, affordable and local cultural spaces.
Every family deserves support, and every young person should have fair opportunities for education, participation and a good future.
Dortmund is a strong economy with social responsibility, fair work and good educational opportunities.
We want to support start-ups and entrepreneurs, strengthen our universities, expand training programs and secure fair wages.
Business, science and work must be considered together – for participation, innovation and long-term prospects for all.
A modern city should also have a digital, measurable and citizen-friendly administration.
Requests should be processed quickly, clearly and multilingually – online and in person.
Especially in the department for migration, waiting times must be shortened and digital offers must be expanded.
Mobility in Dortmund must be accessible to everyone, affordable and climate-friendly.
Dortmund is a city of variety.
People of different backgrounds, religions, languages, lifestyles, with and without disabilities – they all belong to it.
Our city should be a place where all people have the same rights, opportunities and chances to participate.
Diversity is not just a side issue, but a basis for cohesion, democracy and the future.
