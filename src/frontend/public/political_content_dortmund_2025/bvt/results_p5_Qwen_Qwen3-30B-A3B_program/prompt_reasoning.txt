Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by this program. Each description needs to be 3-6 words, concise and informative. 

First, I need to go through the summary and pick out the key points related to the city's appearance. Let me read through the text again.

They mention "more green, playgrounds and cultural offerings." So green spaces and playgrounds are definitely visual aspects. Then there's "clean cities through regular cleaning and reliable waste disposal." That relates to cleanliness, maybe litter or trash. 

"Safe public spaces - through better lighting and attractive urban design." Lighting and urban design are visual. "Cultural offerings" and "cultural spaces" might affect the look of buildings or public art. "Accessible, affordable, climate-friendly mobility" could involve bike lanes, public transport, maybe more green transportation infrastructure. 

"Inter-cultural offers" and "diversity" might influence public art, signage, or community spaces. Also, "digital offers" and "citizen-friendly administration" might not be visual directly, but maybe digital kiosks or information displays. 

Wait, the user asked for visual aspects. So I need to focus on what you can see. Let me list possible points:

1. More green spaces (gardens, parks)
2. Playground installations (playgrounds)
3. Cultural facilities (theaters, galleries)
4. Improved lighting (streetlights, public areas)
5. Clean streets (less litter, waste management)

But the user wants five. Let me check again. The summary mentions "more green, playgrounds and cultural offerings." So that's three. Then "clean cities" and "safe public spaces" (lighting and design). Also, "intercultural offers" which might be murals, cultural centers. "Accessible mobility" could mean bike lanes, pedestrian areas. 

But need to make sure each is a visual aspect. Let me try to extract five:

1. Green spaces (parks, gardens)
2. Playground installations
3. Cultural facilities (museums, theaters)
4. Enhanced street lighting
5. Clean urban areas (neat streets, waste management)

Alternatively, maybe "diverse public art" from intercultural offers. Or "accessible infrastructure" for mobility. But need to be concise. Let me check the exact phrases from the text. 

The summary says "intercultural offers" which could be visual elements like murals, festivals, or cultural centers. "Cultural offerings" and "low-cost cultural spaces" would be visible. 

Also, "attractive urban design" from the safe public spaces part. So maybe "attractive urban design" as a visual aspect. 

So the five could be:

- More green spaces
- Playground installations
- Cultural facilities
- Enhanced street lighting
- Clean urban areas

That's five. Each is a visual aspect. Let me check the word count. Each is 3-6 words. Yes. So the final answer would be those five as a comma-separated list.
