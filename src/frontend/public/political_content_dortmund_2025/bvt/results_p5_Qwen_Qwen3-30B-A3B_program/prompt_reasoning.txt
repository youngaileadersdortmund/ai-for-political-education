Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the given election program summary and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by the program. Each description needs to be 3-6 words, concise and informative. Then, return them as a comma-separated list.

First, I'll read through the program summary carefully. The key points mentioned are education, community spaces, green areas, cleanliness, safety, cultural accessibility, infrastructure, digital administration, mobility, and diversity. 

Now, I need to translate these into visual aspects. Let's see:

1. "More green, playgrounds and cultural offerings." So green spaces and playgrounds are mentioned. That's a visual aspect: Green spaces and playgrounds. But maybe "Green spaces and playgrounds" is 4 words. Wait, the user said 3-6 words. So that's okay.

2. "Clean cities through regular cleaning and reliable waste disposal." Cleanliness is a visual aspect. So "Clean streets and waste management" or "Clean public areas and waste disposal." Maybe "Clean public areas and waste disposal" is 5 words.

3. "Safe public spaces - through better lighting and attractive urban design." Better lighting and urban design. So "Improved lighting and urban design" – 4 words.

4. "Culture for all – through low-cost, affordable and local cultural spaces." Cultural spaces. So "Cultural spaces and local venues" – 4 words.

5. "Mobility in Dortmund must be accessible to everyone, affordable and climate-friendly." Maybe public transport or bike lanes. But the summary mentions mobility, so "Accessible and eco-friendly transport" – 5 words.

Wait, the user might be looking for more specific visual elements. Let me check again. The program talks about community spaces, intercultural offers, diversity, which might relate to public art or signage. But the user wants visual aspects of the city's appearance. So maybe:

- "Community gathering spaces" (from "spaces in which community is possible")
- "Diverse cultural landmarks" (from diversity and cultural offerings)
- "Green recreational areas" (from more green, playgrounds)
- "Well-lit public areas" (from safe public spaces)
- "Accessible transportation hubs" (from mobility)

But I need to make sure each is directly tied to the program's points. Let me cross-reference:

The program mentions promoting lively neighborhoods, meeting places, intercultural offers – so maybe "Community meeting places" (5 words). 

"More green, playgrounds and cultural offerings" – "Green spaces and playgrounds" (4 words).

"Clean cities through regular cleaning and reliable waste disposal" – "Clean public areas and waste management" (5 words).

"Safe public spaces - through better lighting and attractive urban design" – "Improved lighting and urban design" (4 words).

"Culture for all – through low-cost, affordable and local cultural spaces" – "Cultural spaces and local venues" (4 words).

But maybe "Diverse cultural landmarks" is better for the cultural aspect. However, the program emphasizes accessibility and affordability. Alternatively, "Accessible cultural spaces" (4 words). 

Also, the program mentions "mobility" as accessible, affordable, climate-friendly. So "Eco-friendly transport options" (4 words). 

Wait, the user wants 5 aspects. Let me pick the top 5. Maybe:

1. Green spaces and playgrounds
2. Clean public areas and waste management
3. Improved lighting and urban design
4. Cultural spaces and local venues
5. Eco-friendly transport options

That's five. Let me check if each is directly from the program. Yes, the first is from "More green, playgrounds and cultural offerings." The second from "Clean cities through regular cleaning..." Third from "Safe public spaces..." Fourth from "Culture for all..." Fifth from "Mobility... climate-friendly."

Alternatively, maybe "Accessible transportation hubs" instead of "Eco-friendly transport options," but "climate-friendly" is mentioned. So "Eco-friendly transport options" is accurate. 

I think that's a solid list. Now, check word counts: each is between 3-6 words. Yes. So the final answer would be these five, comma-separated.
