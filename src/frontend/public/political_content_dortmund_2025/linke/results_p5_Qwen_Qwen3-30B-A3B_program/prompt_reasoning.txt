Okay, I need to analyze this election program summary and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by this political program. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to pick out the key points related to the city's visual elements.

First, the program talks a lot about housing, affordable housing, and social housing. They mention things like making public transport free, expanding social housing, and preventing gentrification. That makes me think about the physical structures of the cityâ€”like buildings, housing developments, and maybe even the density of housing. So maybe "social housing expansion" is one aspect.

Then there's a lot about public transport, cycling paths, and pedestrian-friendly areas. They mention making cycle paths safer, having 30 km/h speed limits, and improving public transport. This would affect the city's infrastructure, like roads, bike lanes, and public transport stations. So "pedestrian and cycling infrastructure" could be another point.

The program also discusses public spaces, like parks and recreational areas. They mention creating safe spaces for homeless people, improving public facilities, and making them accessible. So "public space accessibility" might be another visual aspect.

Another part is about the environment and green spaces. They talk about green schoolyards, renaturing landscapes, and creating green connections. This would involve more trees, parks, and green areas. So "green urban spaces" could be another one.

Lastly, there's a mention of reducing car dominance, like limiting car traffic, and making streets more pedestrian-friendly. They also talk about removing "defensive architecture" that drives homeless people away. This would change the look of streets and public areas, making them more open and less car-centric. So "car-free public areas" might be the fifth aspect.

Wait, let me check if these are all covered. The user wants five visual aspects. Let me make sure each is concise and matches the program's points. Social housing expansion, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, public space accessibility, green urban spaces, and car-free public areas. That seems to cover the main points. I should verify each against the text again to ensure accuracy.
