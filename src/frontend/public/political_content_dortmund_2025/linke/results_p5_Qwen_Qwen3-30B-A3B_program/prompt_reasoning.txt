Okay, I need to analyze the given election program summary and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by this political program. Let me start by reading through the summary carefully to pick out key points related to urban development, public spaces, transportation, housing, and other infrastructure.

First, the program mentions affordable housing, social housing, and the need to combat housing poverty. This suggests that the visual aspect of housing stock and the availability of affordable homes would be impacted. So maybe "Affordable housing availability" is one.

Next, there's a lot about public transport being free and expanding. The summary talks about improving public transport, cycling paths, and making them safer. So "Public transport infrastructure" could be another aspect, focusing on the expansion and accessibility of transit systems.

The program also discusses pedestrian-friendly streets, reducing car dominance, and making streets safer for pedestrians. They mention issues like noisy streets, lack of shade, and poor air quality. So "Pedestrian-friendly street design" might be a third point.

Another part talks about green spaces, cycle paths, and environmental initiatives like the IGA 2027 and green connections. They mention transforming asphalt schoolyards into green areas. So "Green spaces and urban greenery" could be a fourth aspect.

Lastly, there's a mention of barrier-free public facilities, inclusive design for people with disabilities, and accessible public buildings. The Left emphasizes removing barriers and ensuring accessibility. So "Barrier-free public infrastructure" would be the fifth point.

I need to make sure each of these is concise, 3-6 words, and directly related to visual aspects. Let me check again. Affordable housing availability, public transport infrastructure, pedestrian-friendly street design, green spaces and urban greenery, barrier-free public infrastructure. That seems to cover the key areas mentioned. I think these are the five important visual aspects.
