All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - Education is a human right that belongs to every child, regardless of the social status and income of their parents. The city as the school authority is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the municipal school buildings, including the same high-quality equipment for every location.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for the cost of learning materials in schools, training and studies to be taken over.

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Strong Approval - Securing school routes and transporting students must be the responsibility of the city of Dortmund. This includes cycling and walking as well as the establishment of school bus routes.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund – also in writing:
Approval - The Left is calling for the continuation and expansion of the "Startchancen" support programme and the expansion of vocational counselling in schools. However, the Left is expressly rejecting the involvement of the Bundeswehr in the classroom.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Approval - The Left is also calling for an expansion of the Dortmund Pass, in order to enable children from low-income families to participate in cultural, sports and leisure activities.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Approval - Many schoolyards, especially in densely populated neighborhoods without playgrounds, are open to the public on weekends. A schoolyard that is free of hygiene- and safety-relevant rubbish such as garbage and broken glass not only protects the students, but also contributes to a positive learning environment.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - The Left is campaigning for a free lunch for all school children in full-time care.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Strong Approval - In Dortmund, the social divide is particularly evident in the educational gap between affluent and poor neighbourhoods. The chances of achieving a high level of education and, with it, well-paid jobs are distributed extremely unequally. The school projects supported by the Left, such as "Lernen neu denken" (Thinking about learning) in the Nordstadt and the "KinderCampus Schulen" (Children's Campus Schools) in other neighbourhoods, must therefore be preserved and, if possible, expanded.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Approval - Public learning spaces such as libraries offer all people - regardless of their social background - access to knowledge, space and digital resources as a supplement to the classroom. However, here too, equal distribution in the districts must be ensured and existing structures must be expanded.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Approval - The Left is calling for well-staffed school social work - with one specialist per maximum 150 pupils - at all primary schools. Psychotherapists directly at schools could help to reduce barriers. Due to the current shortage of skilled workers, especially in child and youth psychotherapy, a comprehensive team is not realistic at the moment, but is a worthwhile goal in the medium term.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for more low-threshold offers for the mental health of young people – from school stress to trauma. This includes trauma-sensitive counselling centres for children from addicted or violent families, as well as child protection clinics that combine medical help with psychosocial counselling. These structures must be built up across the board and in the long term.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Approval - The Left supports the demand for free rental bikes for people under 18. Young people should be able to move freely - whether to school, to friends or to leisure activities. Free mobility strengthens social participation and climate protection at the same time.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for more bike parking spaces for rental bikes - especially at bus stops, in the city centre and at educational institutions. Rental systems should be in public hands so that availability and distribution can be socially and ecologically controlled. Parking space regulations must shift the focus away from cars and towards smart land use for sustainable mobility.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for the expansion of protected bike lanes, green phases independent of car traffic and the avoidance of "fear lanes" at intersections.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval - The Left in Dortmund is calling for an end to the criminalisation of poverty. This includes no longer prosecuting people for driving without a ticket. The prosecution mainly affects people who simply cannot afford a ticket. In the long term, the Left is calling for free public transport for everyone, at least in the short term for people with low incomes, children and young people, students and trainees.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - The frequency of the lines must be increased where staff and/or track capacity allow. Especially in the evenings, at night, early in the morning and at weekends, public transport must also be the best possible means of mobility for shift workers.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for a free student ticket for public transport, regardless of the income of the parents.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for the implementation of the expansion plans already drawn up for the DSW21 Stadtbahn lines to the south in Hörde and Hacheney and the development of Kirchlinde by the U47. The focus of further expansion plans must be, among other things, the development of large residential areas and workplaces as well as the train stations in the outer districts.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for school streets, which are closed to traffic around schools and daycare centers, to make it possible for children to travel safely on foot or by bike. Parent taxis lead to dangerous situations directly in front of the facilities - clear traffic-calming measures are needed here. Initiatives like "SpoSpiTo," which motivate children to move and be independent, should be expressly supported.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Approval - Not everyone has a mobile phone and emergency situations are particularly stressful, which is why functioning emergency buttons should be available at all train stations and on all tracks.

Traffic lights in Dortmund are to be checked at least once a month:
Approval - Traffic lights must be regularly checked and maintained, for example, to repair the aids for visually impaired people, which are currently only functioning sporadically.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - Safe routes for cycling and walking are central to socially just, climate-friendly mobility. Children, older people and people with disabilities in particular must be able to move around in public spaces without risk. That is why the Left is calling for protected cycle paths, wider pavements, more zebra crossings and traffic-calmed zones with a high quality of life.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Approval - Enough space for public meeting places allows young people in particular to engage in hobbies and sports. Sports fields at schools also offer multiple uses of space for students and the public.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Approval - Sport and leisure activities are essential for relaxation, stress relief and maintaining health. They also provide opportunities for shared experiences and promote social interaction.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Strong Approval - The proximity of an open swimming pool to every citizen is important. Especially for school swimming, easily accessible baths are essential, so that the lessons do not only consist of traveling to and from the pool. Swimming pools as public facilities also promote participation in social life and are a meeting place for a variety of people.

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Strong Approval - Culture unites. Especially in times of right-wing hysteria, it is important to show commonalities and to provide opportunities for celebration and relaxation. The Left therefore calls for the creative scene to be actively supported - also by providing suitable locations.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - Not everyone can afford mobile data, which is why it is important to set up free Wi-Fi independent of shops and restaurants. It also helps with digitalisation and increases the attractiveness of the districts for pedestrians.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - Young people in particular get their information mainly from digital sources. Online offers can help to reach them in a targeted and low-threshold way and thus strengthen mutual understanding.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Approval - Gastronomy should not only take place in the city centre, but also in the outskirts. The rule of proximity and accessibility must apply equally to every citizen.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for socially disadvantaged groups, such as people with low incomes, people with disabilities and young people, to be included in participation procedures. Participation must be possible in a barrier-free, low-threshold and multilingual manner - also digitally and outside of traditional office hours.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - The future of Dortmund belongs to the youth. Therefore, they should also have the opportunity to actively shape their city of tomorrow. Young people must be systematically included in urban development projects such as parks, playgrounds or new buildings - through participation procedures, youth councils or digital platforms.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - Education is decisive for integration, cultural participation and the perception of political rights. Therefore, education policy must focus more on promoting media literacy and political education in order to counteract disinformation, social division and polarisation.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - The city administration must make its offers and structures more inclusive and at the same time give impetus in the private sector in order to create better conditions for inclusion there as well.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Approval - On the free housing market, trainees can hardly find affordable accommodation. Trainees should have the right to live inexpensively, just like students. This will also increase location flexibility and equal opportunities, as well as reduce dropouts.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Strong Approval - Housing is a human right. The Left is calling for Dortmund to increase the social housing quota to 70% and to create permanent social bonds. Only by better equipping the housing supervisory authority can we take a consistent approach to empty properties and rent gouging.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - Only 5% of Dortmund's playgrounds are barrier-free. Therefore, particular attention must be paid to inclusion in playgrounds, especially in the outer districts. The Left Party is calling for self-managed spaces and youth centres to be strengthened and for appropriate offers to receive sufficient personnel and material resources with more structural and less project funding.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Strong Approval - The Left is committed to ensuring that civil society groups, youth initiatives and clubs can use their own, easily accessible spaces - whether for meetings, rehearsals, events or advice. The provision of such spaces is a central contribution to cultural and social diversity in Dortmund.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for better financial support for the chronically underfunded "social city" action plan. In order to improve living conditions in the particularly impoverished districts of the city, Dortmund should specifically acquire funding from the federal and state governments. This also includes political pressure for an old debt settlement, so that municipal investments in social infrastructure are even possible.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for administrative documents to be available in principle in easy or simple language, in multiple languages and in Braille.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - Just as important as the number is the emptying interval, which must be adapted to the actual needs of the people. Contamination in public spaces must be quickly removed. The Left also demands that free bulky waste collection services be carried out at regular intervals to prevent wild rubbish dumps in residential areas, but also in nature and the environment.

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - Especially in the summer and for citizens affected by poverty, drinking fountains often offer the only possibility of adequate supply of drinking water. These offers must be designed to be barrier-free and should also be signposted for better discoverability.

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for a significant increase in the number of trees on streets and public squares. A canopy of leaves cools the streets and provides fresh air. In addition, at least three replacement trees should be planted when trees are cut down in the street.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - The enormous potential of solar energy, which is mainly offered by the roofs of urban buildings and municipal facilities, must be exploited quickly and comprehensively. Furthermore, the Left Party also calls for the expansion of PV on private roofs to be driven forward, as well as for smaller balcony power plants to be promoted again in a targeted manner, in order to also enable tenants to participate in the energy transition.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for more free and round-the-clock accessible public toilets in central locations in the city centre as well as in all districts.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Strong Approval - The Left will use its function in local committees to publicly name police violence against anti-fascists as well as any form of state support for racists, neo-Nazis and racist politics. It also advocates that public administration employees be sensitized to a prejudice-free and anti-racist approach to all residents.

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - Safe spaces and offers are important in order to create a prejudice-free space for queer youth to get to know their peers. The Left is also calling for queer sports groups to be supported and for safe spaces to be created for queer homeless people.

Drop-in centres are to be set up in every district for gay youths:
Strong Approval - Despite formal gender equality, women and queer people - especially children and young people - are still exposed to numerous forms of discrimination, often even in their own family environment. The Left is therefore calling for more safe spaces and retreats to be established.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - Queer children and young people experience discrimination, exclusion and bullying more frequently. Training helps to reduce prejudices and promote a respectful, open climate in which all young people feel accepted and safe.

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - In this context, the Left is also calling for the barrier-free reconstruction or construction of schools, as well as the hiring of significantly more teachers, in order to enable inclusive teaching for children with support needs.

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - There is still a lack of sports halls in Dortmund that are barrier-free and thus suitable for people with disabilities, even though this should already be standard in new buildings. The Left is calling for a greater focus on the renovation of older halls and sports facilities.

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Strong Approval - The Left is calling for the preservation and expansion of free holiday activities and low-cost holiday camps, which must be designed to be accessible to all children and young people.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has criticised Germany several times because the sheltered workshop system is not geared enough towards inclusive employment. The Left is calling for the abolition of these exploitative businesses and instead for the integration of people into the regular job market, as well as inclusive consultations at schools.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Approval - Children with special support needs must not be excluded from or during trips in order to enable equal participation. Complex bureaucracy must not be a reason for exclusion.
