Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the open election compass answers and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by the political program. They need each aspect described in 3-6 words as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to go through the provided answers and look for mentions of physical changes or elements that would alter the city's visual appearance. The key is to focus on what's visible, not just policies. Let's scan through the points.

Looking at the first few points: "All classrooms... same furniture and digital equipment" – that's about schools, but maybe not the city's overall appearance. "Free school materials" – again, not visual. "School buses" – that's transportation, maybe affecting the streets. "School buses" could lead to more buses on the road, but maybe not the most visual aspect. 

Then "public learning spaces like libraries" – libraries are visible. "Bicycle rental free for under 18" – more bikes, but maybe not as visual as infrastructure. "More bike parking spaces" – that's physical infrastructure. "Cycle paths made safer" – safer paths, maybe with markings or structures. "Free Wi-Fi in central areas" – not visual, more digital. 

"Public multi-purpose sports fields" – visible in schools. "Sports boxes in every district" – maybe small structures. "Swimming pools in every district" – large visible structures. "Plots for new clubs and discos" – could change the skyline. "More public litter bins" – visible, but maybe not the most impactful. "Hygienic drinking fountains" – visible but minor. "Trees planted for shade" –绿化, which is visual. "Solar panels on buildings" – visible, especially on schools and public buildings. "Public toilets in city center" – visible. "Safe places for queer youth" – maybe not visual. "Inclusive leisure facilities" – could be design changes. 

So, possible visual aspects: 
1. Bike parking spaces (more bike racks)
2. Cycle paths (safer, maybe with markings or barriers)
3. Libraries and learning spaces (new buildings or renovations)
4. Solar panels on buildings (visible installations)
5. Tree-lined public spaces (more trees)

Wait, but the user asked for 5. Let me check again. The user might be looking for things that are directly visible in the cityscape. So, bike parking, cycle paths, libraries, solar panels, and maybe green spaces (trees). Alternatively, public toilets, but not sure. Also, maybe the addition of sports facilities. But the user wants 5. Let me make sure each is a visual aspect. 

Another angle: "more bike parking spaces" – visible. "Cycle paths made safer" – visible. "Public learning spaces like libraries" – visible. "Solar panels on schools and buildings" – visible. "Trees planted for shade" – visible. That's five. Alternatively, maybe "barrier-free facilities" but that's more about accessibility than visual. 

I think the five would be: 
- Increased bike parking infrastructure
- Safer cycle paths with markings
- Expansion of public libraries
- Solar panel installations on buildings
- Tree-lined public spaces

But need to make sure each is concise. Maybe "Bike parking infrastructure" (5 words), "Safer cycle paths" (3), "Public library expansions" (4), "Solar panel installations" (4), "Tree-lined public spaces" (4). That's five. Alternatively, maybe "More public libraries" instead of expansions. But the user wants 3-6 words. Let me check the exact wording. The user says "visual aspects of a city appearance" so things you can see. So yes, bike parking, cycle paths, libraries, solar panels, trees. That's five. I'll go with that.
