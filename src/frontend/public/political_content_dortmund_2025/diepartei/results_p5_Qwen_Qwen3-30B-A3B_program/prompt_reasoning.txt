Okay, let's see. The user wants me to analyze this election program summary and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by it. Then, I need to describe each in 3-6 words as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to understand the key points of the program. The main themes seem to be about the economy, noise and food (like falafel), mobility rights, fare evasion, and denazification. There's also a mention of rainbow-colored uniforms for council members.

So, the visual aspects. Let's break it down. The first part says "Dortmunder Wirtschaften are system-relevant." That might relate to the economy, so maybe more businesses or commercial areas. Then "noise or falafel" â€“ maybe more street vendors or food stalls, which would be a visual element. "Even at 3 a.m." suggests nightlife or late-night activities, so maybe more lights or signs in the city at night.

Mobility as a basic right: if people can't afford tickets, they might use alternative transport, like bikes or walking, which could affect the city's infrastructure. But the part about "travel illegally" and "free fare dodging subscription" might lead to more people avoiding public transport, maybe affecting the use of public spaces or the appearance of ticket checkpoints.

The "denazify Dortmund" part could mean removing symbols or monuments related to Nazism, so visual elements like statues, plaques, or buildings with such symbols. Also, the rainbow-colored uniforms for council members would be a visual change, making the council members stand out in colorful attire.

So possible visual aspects: 1. Increased street vendors (falafel), 2. Nighttime lighting or activity, 3. Public transport infrastructure (maybe more bikes or less ticket machines), 4. Removal of Nazi symbols, 5. Rainbow-colored council uniforms.

Wait, but the user wants aspects of the city's appearance. So maybe:

1. More street food stalls (falafel)
2. Nighttime illumination (3 a.m. activities)
3. Public transport accessibility (mobility rights)
4. Removal of Nazi memorabilia
5. Rainbow-colored council uniforms

But need to make sure each is a visual aspect. Also, the part about "free fare dodging subscription" might not directly affect the city's appearance, but the "cap on fines with bottles" might not be visual. The "denazify" part would definitely affect monuments or symbols. The rainbow uniforms are a direct visual change. 

So final list: 
- Increased street food vendors (falafel)
- Nighttime activity illumination
- Public transport accessibility (maybe more bike lanes or less ticket booths)
- Removal of Nazi symbols
- Rainbow-colored council uniforms
