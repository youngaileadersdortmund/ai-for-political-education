Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the open election compass answers and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city appearance affected by the political program. Each aspect needs to be a concise 3-6 word description. 

First, I need to go through each of the given answers and look for elements that relate to the visual appearance of the city. The key is to focus on what's mentioned in the answers that would change the look of the city. Let me go through each point one by one.

Starting with the first answer: "All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment." This might affect the uniformity of school interiors, but that's more about the inside. Maybe not directly a visual aspect of the city. 

Next, "All students should receive school materials free of charge." Not sure about the visual impact here. 

"Students at secondary schools should not receive free iPads." Rejection here, but again, more about equipment. 

"The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses." School buses might affect the traffic and the presence of buses around schools, but not sure if that's a visual aspect of the city's appearance. 

"All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions..." Not visual. 

"The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities..." Maybe not. 

"The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly..." Cleaning the schoolyards would make them look better, so this could be a visual aspect. 

"The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch." Not directly visual. 

"Free learning and education opportunities..." Not sure. 

"The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries." Libraries are public spaces, so their presence would affect the city's appearance. 

"Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists." Not visual. 

"City should create more offers for mental health..." Not visual. 

"Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18." Free bikes might affect the number of bikes on streets, but maybe not the visual aspects. 

"Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces..." Bike parking spaces would be visible, so that's a visual aspect. 

"Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer." Safer cycle paths could mean better design, which affects the visual appearance. 

"City should provide greater financial support for public transport..." More public transport might mean more buses or trains, but not sure. 

"Buses and trains more frequently..." More frequent services might not be visual. 

"Students allowed to use buses and trains for free." Again, not directly visual. 

"More tram connections..." Trams are part of the city's infrastructure, so their presence would affect the visual appearance. 

"Parent taxis restricted." Maybe not. 

"Functioning emergency call buttons at train stations." Not visual. 

"Use of flashing lights avoided..." Flashing lights might affect the traffic signs, but not sure. 

"Traffic lights checked monthly." Not visual. 

"Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists expanded." Safer routes could mean better infrastructure, which is visual. 

"Public multi-purpose sports field at every school site." Sports fields would be visible. 

"Sports boxes in every district." Sports boxes (like courts) would be visible. 

"Every district gets its own swimming pool." Swimming pools are visible. 

"Suitable plots for new clubs and discos." New buildings, so visual. 

"Free Wi-Fi in central areas." Wi-Fi isn't visual, but maybe the infrastructure? Not sure. 

"Online portal for leisure and educational offers." Not visual. 

"Promote restaurants in outskirts." New restaurants would be visible. 

"Participation formats for all groups." Not visual. 

"Allow young people to have a say in town planning." Not directly visual. 

"Promote digital offers for politics." Not visual. 

"Employ people with disabilities in businesses." Not visual. 

"Separate homes for trainees." Maybe new buildings. 

"Tighten social housing regulations." New housing developments. 

"Rise in basic tax." Not visual. 

"Offers for young people in every district." Maybe new facilities. 

"City provides rooms for groups and associations." New rooms, so visual. 

"Actively acquire funding for social measures." Not visual. 

"Provide information in multiple languages." Not visual. 

"More public litter bins." Litter bins are visible. 

"Hygienic drinking fountains." Visible. 

"Trees planted for shade." Trees are a visual aspect. 

"Solar panels on schools and buildings." Solar panels are visible. 

"Additional public toilets in city center." Visible. 

"Security forces on patrol in underground trains." Not visual. 

"Police training on racism." Not visual. 

"More safe places for queer youth." New facilities. 

"Drop-in centers for gay youths." Visible. 

"Training for diversity in schools." Not visual. 

"Inclusive offers in schools." Not visual. 

"Leisure facilities barrier-free." Not visual. 

"More inclusive holiday offers." Not visual. 

"Targeted support for disabled career choices." Not visual. 

"Additional costs for school trips accessible." Not visual.

Now, compiling the visual aspects:

1. Clean schoolyards (from the answer about cleaning outside areas).
2. Public libraries (establishing more public learning spaces).
3. Bike parking spaces (more bike parking).
4. Safer cycle paths (improved cycle paths).
5. Tram connections (more trams in the city).
6. Sports facilities (sports fields and boxes).
7. New restaurants (promoting restaurants in outskirts).
8. Litter bins (more public litter bins).
9. Trees (planting trees for shade).
10. Solar panels (on buildings).
11. Public toilets (additional toilets).
12. Safe spaces for queer youth (new facilities).

But need to pick 5. Let's see which are most directly related to the city's appearance. 

- Clean schoolyards (cleanliness of public areas)
- Bike parking spaces (visible infrastructure)
- Safer cycle paths (improved road design)
- Tram connections (public transport infrastructure)
- Tree planting (green spaces)

Alternatively, maybe:

1. Clean schoolyards
2. Bike parking spaces
3. Safer cycle paths
4. Tram infrastructure
5. Tree-lined streets

But need to check the answers again. The answer about "cycle paths must be made safer" would lead to better-designed cycle paths, which is a visual aspect. "More tram connections" would mean more trams and tracks, which are visible. "Planting trees" affects the city's greenery. "Bike parking spaces" are visible. "Clean schoolyards" improve the appearance of schools, which are part of the city's visual aspects.

So the five could be:

- Clean schoolyards
- Bike parking spaces
- Safer cycle paths
- Tram infrastructure
- Tree-lined streets

But need to make sure each is 3-6 words. Let me check:

- Clean schoolyards (5)
- Bike parking spaces (4)
- Safer cycle paths (4)
- Tram connections (3)
- Tree-lined streets (4)

Alternatively, maybe "Tram infrastructure" instead of "Tram connections". Or "Expanded cycle paths" for safer ones. But the user wants concise descriptions. So the final list would be those five.
