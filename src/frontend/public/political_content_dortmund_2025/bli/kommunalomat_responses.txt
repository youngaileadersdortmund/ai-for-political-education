All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Approval - A minimum standard is to be achieved in all schools and classrooms. Schools may plan and implement more extensive specific equipment.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Rejection - Teaching materials should remain free of charge. Schools may, if necessary, determine an appropriate(!) own contribution. This does not apply to writing materials, art or sports equipment, for example. JobCenter customers receive a lump sum for ongoing services, which is intended for school materials. If parents spend this money elsewhere, the children will suffer the consequences. Common sense: what is simply given away is not valued.

Students at secondary schools should not receive free iPads:
Rejection - The iPads are often integrated very sensibly into the lessons. How else can media competence be taught? They enable online lessons if necessary. Messenger and other school-specific functions are possible. There is an immense amount of work involved in issuing/returning/maintaining/updating the devices in schools, which dedicated teachers "just sort of do on the side".

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Strong Rejection - The feasibility of the respective school is certainly not the main problem of our educational landscape, but what happens in and around the schools, --> or what does not happen.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund â€“ also in writing:
Rejection - The current range of information is extensive, but unfortunately sometimes also excessive. There is a lack of overview, but not of offers.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Neutral - Schools and clubs or initiatives are usually active and busy in numerous networks, possibly also in cooperations. An information offer from the town certainly does not harm, but is probably not absolutely necessary in most cases.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - What else? The Monday morning state of a schoolyard decides the learning atmosphere. The arrival in the school week determines the social structure of the rest of the week.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - Definitely! Schools are more or less successfully putting together their own solutions, e.g. with the OGS sponsorship, sponsoring, BuT variants...  --> All Murks! Give the kiddies something to eat, then we'll see further.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Neutral - The need for this is very unevenly distributed across the city. Yes, in general, but only after an analysis of need. Learning and educational opportunities also always mean spaces for social life!

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Approval - Here too, the need in the respective district should be examined beforehand. Public learning locations should be able to reflect the entire spectrum of education - from literacy to university studies.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - Definitely. Teachers cannot possibly pick up all the baggage that young people carry with them from a very early age in teaching situations. This is not only true for socially disadvantaged families! In principle, this is a minimum requirement that should also be addressed to the state government.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Approval - Going out, team building, the good old fresh air,... experiences instead of pure teaching content. That makes sense when it comes to raising responsible and self-determined people. Whether this can be achieved by the municipality alone is questionable.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Strong Rejection - In the spirit of appreciation, young people in particular should bring a willingness to make a contribution themselves to an offer that is - far from being a given.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Approval - A well thought-out network of parking and pick-up points makes the overall offer meaningful.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - In the interest of ALL road users: cycle paths are either done properly or not at all! "Curb hopping" and chaotic traffic light sequences are the last thing we need in Dortmund.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval - Other cities have shown the way: lowering prices leads to better occupancy rates and significantly fewer losses than most people fear. In our city, unfortunately, we can only watch as ticket prices rise.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - An attractive timetable and coverage in public transport must become a core element of Dortmund's transport policy. Give me a chance to use public transport in everyday life, and I'll gladly give up my car.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Approval - Uncomplicated mobility within the city area leads to orientation and thus also contributes significantly to the personal connection to "my city".

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Strong Approval - Of course! By the way: the world does not end at the city limits! Ask in Wasserkurl, Buchholz, Groppenbruch etc.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Rejection - We should not ban this by dictating to families how they should organise themselves. This is a task for each family - and for each school. The disadvantages of the parent taxi are well known and largely undisputed.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - Security in public spaces MUST be increased.

The use of flashing lights is to be avoided to increase traffic safety:
Approval - You can't just do without these annoying things. But if they are only geared towards maximum yield with a trapper's instinct, then this has nothing to do with traffic safety and should be stopped.

Traffic lights in Dortmund are to be checked at least once a month:
Neutral - Regular checks of the function and programming are advisable. The interval is determined by the relevant department of the town administration.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Approval - Emphasis on "safety" for all involved. Pedestrians are wrongly at the bottom of the safety chain.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Rejection - A concept can show the needs and possibilities. It is often useful - but not everywhere.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Approval - A concept can show the needs and possibilities for this, and this should also include the possibility of ball courts.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Approval - First of all, the Herculean task of renovating Dortmund's baths needs to be tackled. If all the existing baths were in a usable condition, we would already be well equipped. What we really need is a family leisure bath.

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Neutral - Here the guiding principle of supply and demand applies. However, clubs and discos are not least commercial enterprises. They do not operate for the public good, but for profit.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - Positive effects on the urban community are inevitable, for example, for attractiveness and quality of life. In the best sense, an investment in the future of our city.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Neutral - It does not need to be reinvented. Existing offers simply need to be brought together in a meaningful way.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Strong Approval - Economic resilience, cityscape, quality of life, neighborhood meeting places, urban culture.... I could go on and on...

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - Participation opportunities must be made available to citizens. Not just advisory boards and remote administrative consultation hours. However, the city society must take initiative and get a grip on its own nose --> People, do something!

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - What else?

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Approval - So, self-participation. Politics does not happen by itself. It is made by people - and in the best case, for people.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Neutral - People should be hired based on their qualifications. Impairment should not be a disadvantage or a preference.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Rejection - The demand must be raised with the respective chambers. If it needs it, then by all means. At the moment, this is hardly necessary.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Approval - Housing planning in Dortmund is an absolute KEY ISSUE for our future as a functioning city! No concept can be so far-fetched that one does not at least have to think about it. Think out of the box!

The basic tax in Dortmund is to rise.:
Strong Rejection - 

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Neutral - 

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Rejection - Consultation with the clubs provides an opinion. Actually, Dortmund is not so badly placed here.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - Too little is still being done here.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Approval - When selecting foreign languages, discrimination should be avoided. Who selects the languages? Honestly: in times of Google Translate, this should not be a problem.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - 

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - 

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - 

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - 

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - 

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Strong Approval - 

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Approval - 

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - You don't have to reinvent the wheel. You just have to make existing public facilities more aware.

Drop-in centres are to be set up in every district for gay youths:
Strong Approval - Acceptance of our diverse society begins - and unfortunately ends - in every single head. Contact points are necessary; however, they do not solve the fundamental problem.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - 

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - That is already law!

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - That is already law!

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Neutral - Inclusion must at some point become a matter of course. It should no longer be necessary to point it out.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - This task goes far beyond Dortmund's borders. There are numerous rehabilitation offers from the employment agency or job center, but unfortunately they are still too bureaucratic.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - I'm for it!
