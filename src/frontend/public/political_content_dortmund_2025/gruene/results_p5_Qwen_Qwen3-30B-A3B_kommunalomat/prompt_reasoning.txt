Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the open election compass answers provided and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by the political program. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words, concise and informative. Then return them as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to go through the given answers and look for mentions of visual elements. The key here is to focus on aspects that are visually noticeable in a city's appearance. Let me scan through the points again.

The first answer mentions "All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment." That relates to school interiors, but maybe the visual aspect here is the uniformity of school facilities. But maybe more about the exterior? Not sure. Wait, the user is asking about the city's appearance, so maybe schools' exteriors or public spaces.

Another point: "The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends." Cleaning affects the visual appearance of school exteriors, so that's a possible aspect: Clean school exteriors.

Then there's "The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city." Not sure if that's visual. Maybe not. 

"Free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts." That's more about infrastructure, but maybe the presence of Wi-Fi hotspots could be a visual aspect, but maybe not. Alternatively, the digital infrastructure might not be visual. Maybe not.

"Public multi-purpose sports fields at every school site." So, sports fields are visible in the city's landscape. That's a visual aspect: Sports fields.

"Sports boxes in every district." Sports boxes like fitness equipment in parks? That would be visible. So, sports facilities.

"Every district should get its own swimming pool." Pools are visible structures. So, swimming pools.

"Free Wi-Fi in all central areas" – maybe not visual. But maybe the presence of digital infrastructure signs? Not sure. Maybe not the best fit.

"Trees planted in public spaces for shade." Trees are definitely a visual aspect. So, tree-lined streets.

"Schools and public buildings equipped with solar panels." Solar panels on rooftops are visible. So, solar panels on buildings.

"Additional public toilets in the city center." Toilets are structures, so visible. But maybe not the most impactful. Alternatively, maybe the cleanliness of public areas, but that's covered by the cleaning of school areas.

"Bike parking spaces for rental bikes." Bike racks are visual. So, bike parking infrastructure.

"Cycle paths made safer." Safe cycle paths could involve better signage, lighting, or physical barriers. So, cycle paths with safety features.

"More bike parking spaces." As above.

"Public learning spaces like libraries." Libraries are buildings, so their presence and design. So, libraries and learning centers.

"Barrier-free sports facilities." Accessible facilities, but maybe the design is more about functionality than visual. Not sure.

"Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists." This might involve crosswalks, signage, or dedicated lanes, which are visual elements. So, pedestrian and bike paths.

"More safe places for queer youth." Not sure about visual aspects here. Maybe the presence of specific facilities, but not sure.

"Leisure and educational offers for young people online." Digital, not visual.

"Promote restaurants in the outskirts." Restaurants are buildings, so their presence. But maybe not the main visual aspect.

"Participation formats for all groups." Not visual.

"More public litter bins." Litter bins are visible, but maybe not the most significant.

"Hygienic drinking fountains." Fountains are visible, but maybe not as impactful.

"Trees planted for shade." As before, tree-lined streets.

"Public toilets in the city center." Toilets as structures.

So, compiling these, the key visual aspects would be:

1. Clean school exteriors (from the cleaning of outside areas)
2. Sports fields and facilities (multi-purpose sports fields, sports boxes)
3. Tree-lined streets (planting trees for shade)
4. Solar panels on buildings (schools and public buildings)
5. Bike parking and cycle paths (bike parking spaces, safer cycle paths)

Wait, but the user wants 5. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe:

- Clean school exteriors
- Sports facilities (fields, boxes)
- Tree-lined streets
- Solar panel installations
- Bike infrastructure (parking, paths)

But the user wants 5. Let me make sure each is a distinct visual aspect. Also, the answer should be concise, 3-6 words each. Let me check the original answers again for other possible aspects.

Another point: "The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries." So, libraries as public buildings. That's a visual aspect. So maybe "Public libraries and learning centers."

Also, "More safe places and offers for queer youth" – maybe not visual. 

"Barrier-free sports facilities" – maybe the design, but not sure.

"Public toilets in the city center" – visible structures.

But perhaps the top 5 would be:

1. Clean school exteriors
2. Sports facilities (fields, courts)
3. Tree-lined streets
4. Solar panel installations
5. Bike parking and cycle paths

Alternatively, maybe "Public libraries and learning centers" as a separate point.

But the user might expect more about the city's overall appearance, like parks, buildings, infrastructure. Let me think again.

Another angle: The program includes more public spaces, like parks with sports facilities, libraries, bike infrastructure, etc. So:

- Public parks with sports facilities
- Tree-lined streets
- Solar panel installations
- Bike parking and cycle paths
- Libraries and learning centers

But need to check if these are directly mentioned. The answer mentions "sports boxes in every district" and "public multi-purpose sports fields." So "Sports facilities in public areas" could be one. "Tree-lined streets" from planting trees. "Solar panels on buildings." "Bike parking infrastructure" from the bike parking and cycle paths. "Libraries and learning centers" from the public learning spaces.

Alternatively, "Clean school exteriors" is another. So maybe:

1. Clean school exteriors
2. Sports facilities
3. Tree-lined streets
4. Solar panel installations
5. Bike parking infrastructure

That's five. Each is a visual aspect. Let me check if these are all covered in the answers. Yes:

- "outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly" → clean school exteriors
- "public multi-purpose sports field at every school site" and "sports boxes in every district" → sports facilities
- "trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade" → tree-lined streets
- "schools and public buildings equipped with solar panels" → solar panels
- "more bike parking spaces for rental bikes" and "cycle paths made safer" → bike parking and infrastructure

Yes, these are all covered. So the five would be:

Clean school exteriors, Sports facilities, Tree-lined streets, Solar panel installations, Bike parking infrastructure.

But the user wants each description to be 3-6 words. Let me check:

1. Clean school exteriors (5 words)
2. Sports facilities (2 words)
3. Tree-lined streets (3 words)
4. Solar panel installations (4 words)
5. Bike parking infrastructure (4 words)

Alternatively, maybe "Bike parking and cycle paths" (5 words). But the user might prefer more concise. Let me see if there's a better way. Maybe "Bike infrastructure" (2 words) but that's too vague. Alternatively, "Bike parking spaces" (3 words). But the answer mentions both parking and cycle paths. Maybe "Bike parking and cycle paths" (5 words) as one item.

Alternatively, split into two: "Bike parking spaces" and "Safe cycle paths." But the user wants 5. Let me check the original instructions again: "5 important visual aspects of a city appearance that would be affected or impacted by this political program."

So, I think the five I have are valid. Now, present them as comma-separated list.
