Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the open election compass answers provided and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by the political program. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the answers and look for mentions of physical changes or improvements to the city's environment. The key is to focus on visual elements that would be noticeable in the city's appearance.

Looking at the points mentioned: 

1. **Schools with modern facilities and clean areas** – The answers talk about clean and attractive learning environments, regular cleaning of school exteriors, and modern school buildings. That points to **clean and well-maintained school areas**.

2. **Public transport improvements** – There's mention of more frequent buses and trains, safer cycle paths, and better bike parking. These affect the **urban infrastructure and traffic design**.

3. **Green spaces and trees** – Planting trees for shade and improving public spaces with more greenery. This relates to **increased greenery and tree planting**.

4. **Public amenities like toilets and litter bins** – Installing more public toilets and litter bins would impact the **public hygiene and cleanliness**.

5. **Bike lanes and pedestrian areas** – Expanding safe routes for cyclists and pedestrians, including car-free zones around schools. This would change the **pedestrian and cycling infrastructure**.

Wait, but I need to make sure these are visual aspects. Let me check again. 

- **Clean and well-maintained school areas** – Yes, visible in school environments.
- **Urban infrastructure and traffic design** – Includes bike lanes, bus lanes, which are visual.
- **Increased greenery and tree planting** – Trees and green spaces are visual.
- **Public hygiene and cleanliness** – Litter bins and toilets contribute to the city's appearance.
- **Pedestrian and cycling infrastructure** – Bike lanes and pedestrian zones are visual.

That seems to cover 5 aspects. Let me verify if there are other possible ones. The answer also mentions libraries, sports facilities, and public spaces. But the user asked for 5, so these five should be solid. Need to ensure each is concise and within the word limit.
