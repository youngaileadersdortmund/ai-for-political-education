Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary for Dortmund and identify 5 important visual aspects of the city's appearance that would be affected by the political program. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the provided program and look for sections that mention changes to the city's physical environment. The program covers a lot of areas like climate neutrality, sustainable building, transportation, green spaces, etc. 

Looking at the key points, there's a lot about greening the city, like "de-paving, greening, and sponge city concepts." That makes me think of more green spaces and parks. Then there's mention of "expanding renewable energy," which might relate to solar panels on buildings. 

The part about "expanding the tram network" and "cycle paths that connect" suggests changes in transportation infrastructure, so maybe more bike lanes and public transport. Also, "barrier-free concepts" and "safe cycling" could relate to pedestrian-friendly areas and sidewalks. 

Another point is "trees and forests" and "natural agriculture," which might lead to more tree-lined streets and green spaces. Also, "clean waterways" could mean cleaner rivers and maybe more water features in the city. 

I need to pick the top 5. Let me list possible ones:

1. Increased green spaces (from de-paving, sponge city concepts)
2. Solar panel installations (renewable energy, solar on buildings)
3. Expanded cycling infrastructure (bike paths, cycle zones)
4. Pedestrian-friendly areas (barrier-free, wider sidewalks)
5. Tree-lined streets (trees and forests, urban greening)

Wait, but the user wants visual aspects. So maybe "more green spaces," "solar panels on buildings," "bike lanes," "wider sidewalks," and "tree-lined streets." That fits 3-6 words each. Let me check the program again to make sure these are covered. 

Yes, "de-paving, greening" and "sponge city" relate to green spaces. "Solar installations" and "green roofs" are mentioned. "Cycle paths that connect" and "safe cycling" are there. "Barrier-free concept" and "wider sidewalks" are in the mobility section. "Trees and forests" and "greening" are also mentioned. 

I think these five aspects are covered. Let me make sure each is concise and within the word limit. Yep, they all fit. So the final answer would be those five as a comma-separated list.
