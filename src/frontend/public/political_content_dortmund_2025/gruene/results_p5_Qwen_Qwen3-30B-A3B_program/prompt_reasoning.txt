Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by the program. Each description needs to be concise, 3-6 words. 

First, I'll read through the provided program to understand the key points. The program covers climate neutrality, sustainable building, renewable energy, green spaces, public transport, and more. 

Looking for visual aspects, I should focus on elements that would change the city's look. For example, "green spaces" and "trees" are mentioned, which relate to urban greening. Then, there's a lot about public transport, like expanding trams and bike paths, which would affect the streetscape. 

Another point is the removal of barriers and making streets pedestrian-friendly, which ties into "barrier-free streets." Also, the mention of "sponge city concepts" and "de-paving" suggests changes in road surfaces, maybe more permeable materials. 

Renewable energy installations like solar panels on buildings would be visible, so "solar installations on buildings" is a good one. 

I need to make sure each aspect is a visual element and directly tied to the program. Let me check again: 

1. Green spaces and trees for climate resilience.
2. Expanded bike and pedestrian paths.
3. Solar panels on buildings.
4. De-paved and permeable surfaces.
5. Barrier-free street designs.

That's five. Each is a visual aspect that would change the city's appearance. Now, condense each into 3-6 words. 

1. Increased urban greenery and tree coverage
2. Expanded bike and pedestrian pathways
3. Solar panel installations on buildings
4. De-paved and permeable surfaces
5. Barrier-free street designs

That should work. Let me verify each against the program. Yes, the program mentions green spaces, bike paths, solar installations, de-paving, and barrier-free concepts. Looks good.
