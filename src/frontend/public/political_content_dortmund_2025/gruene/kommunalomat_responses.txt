All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment:
Strong Approval - School is more than just lessons. For us Greens, schools are central living spaces. This includes modern school buildings that invite you to learn and healthy, good food for everyone – regardless of the parents’ financial situation. And this includes flexible spaces where individual and group learning is possible. We want schools where every child can develop their potential, no matter where they come from.

All students should receive school materials free of charge:
Strong Approval - Education should be independent of the parents' wallet! That is why we clearly stand for free educational offers and school materials. We will provide (digital) textbooks for all students free of charge.

Students at secondary schools should not receive free iPads:
Strong Rejection - In order to best prepare children and young people for the challenges of the future, we must also use the opportunities of digitalisation in our schools.
We expressly support the equipping of all students with digital devices such as iPads to promote digital participation.

We want to establish gigabit internet and WLAN in all schools and youth facilities and provide up-to-date hardware such as tablets, interactive whiteboards and 3D printers for all schools.

The city of Dortmund should provide every school with school buses:
Neutral - The way to school must be safe, flexible and easy.
We have been heavily involved in the establishment of school streets and safe school routes.
We demand the improvement of school infrastructure.

We want to promote school route plans, "Walking Bus" and Bicibus initiatives at schools, improve the public transport connection to schools, especially in the outskirts. As well as offer the GermanyTicket School free of charge to all students.

All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund – also in writing:
Strong Approval - The transition from school to work or voluntary service often decides how young people find their place in society. We Greens are committed to ensuring that no young person is left alone on this path. That is why we have strengthened existing counselling services in Dortmund and are committed to comprehensive, reliable support. We want all students to be informed early and specifically about their options – whether it is vocational training, university or voluntary service. Career orientation must not be a privilege, but must be part of a fair education policy. Our goal: real prospects for all.

The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city:
Strong Approval - Leisure time is more than just a way to pass the time – it is the key to participation and cohesion. We Greens are committed to ensuring that all children and young people in Dortmund have access to the diverse range of activities in their city – regardless of their background, financial situation or language.
That is why we demand: Information about sports, cultural and leisure activities must be brought directly into schools – in a way that is easy to understand, low-threshold and regular. Because those who know what is possible can take part.
Diversity must be experienced, on the football pitch, in the youth centre, in the theatre group. We want Dortmund’s leisure landscape to be as diverse as its society. And we ensure that these activities are developed with genuine youth participation. Only in this way can a city be created in which everyone belongs.

The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends.:
Strong Approval - We want clean and attractive learning environments and we are committed to maintaining well-kept and safe school environments.

The city of Dortmund should offer all children in schools a free lunch:
Strong Approval - No one should have to learn on an empty stomach. That is why we, the Greens in Dortmund, have partially brought about and actively supported free breakfast offers at primary schools. But that is not enough. We want all students to receive a good, warm lunch – free of charge, healthy, organic and from the region. This requires enough and well-equipped canteens at all schools with full-day care.

There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district.:
Strong Approval - Learning locations such as libraries have been strengthened and expanded in the vicinity of residential areas, for example with the Nordstadtbibliothek.

The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries:
Strong Approval - We have specifically promoted public learning locations such as libraries.

Our libraries play an important role in Dortmund. Not only can all people have access to literature through them, but their events, courses and learning locations are indispensable for education and also for social cohesion in our city.

Therefore, we will
    • promote libraries and bookshops close to home and the expansion in other parts of the city and finance and implement necessary renovations.
    • expand the offer of open quiet and learning locations in municipal libraries
    • equip the planned district library in Nordstadt well, for example with multilingual books, and maintain all existing district libraries.
    • enable every primary school class in Nordstadt to visit the new district library and issue a library card to each child
    • support the libraries in their adaptation to digital and new requirements.

Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists:
Strong Approval - School social work was secured and expanded by GREEN motions.

The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people:
Strong Approval - Mental health projects such as "Seelenpflaster" have been promoted.

Bicycle rental in Dortmund should be free for all under 18 years of age:
Strong Approval - The metropolradruhr offer was significantly expanded at the request of the GREENS. In particular, cargo bikes and additional stations were added.

Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes:
Strong Approval - We will work together with bike rental providers like metropolradruhr to ensure that even more stations with more bikes are set up. We have also already supported more than 1,000 bike parking spaces and other infrastructure in the last 5 years.

Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer:
Strong Approval - We Greens are consistently committed to safe and well-developed cycle paths. We have created numerous new cycle paths, closed gaps, designated cycle streets and implemented measures for traffic safety – for example, through a 30 km/h speed limit, safe crossings and better separation of cycle and car traffic. We continue to demand a comprehensive expansion of safe, continuous and motorised cycle paths. The goal is a real “cycling city of Dortmund”, in which children, senior citizens and inexperienced people can move around on their bikes without fear.

The city of Dortmund should provide greater financial support for the use of public transport and reduce ticket prices:
Strong Approval - Mobility should not be a question of money. We, the Greens, want all school children in Dortmund to be able to travel for free on buses and trains – with a free Germany School Ticket. Because anyone who wants to go to school, to play sports or to visit friends should be able to do so easily and safely, regardless of their parents’ income. At the same time, we are fighting for an affordable social ticket, so that adults with little money can also be mobile and independent. Fair mobility is a question of participation and the future.

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Strong Approval - Some timetable adjustments and new lines have already been decided. 

Buses transport thousands of Dortmunders every day on short and long routes through Dortmund. For us, it is clear: the journey with buses and trains must be comfortable. Bus traffic must serve the everyday routes of the people. And the bus must arrive on time. 

For this, we will, among other things

    • generally grant buses automatic priority at traffic lights (priority switching). 
    • set up dedicated bus lanes on core routes and, if possible. 
    • re-plan important traffic axes and set up a bicycle and bus lane as well as a speed limit of 30 km/h.

Students should be allowed to use buses and trains for free:
Strong Approval - We want to offer the DeutschlandTicket Schule free of charge to all students.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Strong Approval - We want a well-developed and modern public transport system. Fewer cars mean less noise, better air and more space in our city. An attractive local transport system makes life easier, fairer and more climate-friendly. That is why we are committed to ensuring that buses and trains are on time, clean and affordable – and that everyone in Dortmund can get to their destination quickly.

However, the lives of many Dortmund residents do not end at the city limits. Wherever possible, we want to advocate for the city of Dortmund to expand the network and increase the frequency of services in discussions with the VRR, Deutsche Bahn and other companies.

We will, among other things,
    • ensure that the Stadtbahn connects the district of Kirchlinde
    • extend the U44 to Westfalenhütte
    • work to relocate stops where a better transfer to the Dortmund local transport system or better access to important destinations can be achieved (e.g. Dortmund Tierpark, Aplerbeck Süd, Barop S) and to use potentials for additional access to the stops (e.g. a rear exit at Bf Hör

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Strong Approval - Students should be able to get to school safely – on foot, by bike or scooter. This requires streets that belong to them. We Greens have therefore initiated and actively supported the introduction of car-free school streets in Dortmund.

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval - Emergency call systems have already been installed at some of the city rail stops. In the context of the barrier-free reconstruction, safety at stops will also be addressed in the future.

The use of flashing lights is to be avoided to increase traffic safety:
Strong Rejection - Our initiative has already led to more speed cameras being installed for traffic safety.

Traffic lights in Dortmund are to be checked at least once a month:
Strong Approval - We have launched a “GREEN WAVE” for cycling. 28 traffic lights have been converted so far and more will follow. The system will also be extended to pedestrians, so that people with mobility impairments will also be able to cross the road safely in the future.

Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded:
Strong Approval - We are committed to a city in which all people can move safely and freely – whether on foot, in a wheelchair or with a stroller. A city in which barrier-free access is not a special case, but a matter of course. A city that puts people at the center. The transportation revolution also means making pedestrian traffic safer and more attractive. The design of our streets must take into account the weakest road users, so that everyone feels equally safe. Our vision is clear: a city in which everyone can reach their destination on foot. A city that does not exclude anyone. For this reason, the goal must be to create more safety for pedestrians in every re-planning and new planning of a street.

There should be a public multi-purpose sports field at every school site:
Strong Approval - Movement needs space – and that for everyone. We Greens demand that the sports facilities at our schools are finally modernised and expanded. Because dilapidated gyms and broken down playing fields not only hinder physical education, but also enthusiasm for movement.

For us, it is clear: every sports facility must be barrier-free. All children and young people – with and without disabilities – should be able to play sports without encountering obstacles.

Good sports facilities are investments in health, community and participation.

Sports boxes are to be installed in every district:
Strong Approval - We are committed to an inclusive, diverse sports landscape that leaves no one out. Many people in Dortmund use the parks to engage in sports and relax. We see this as an opportunity to make our city even better, greener and healthier.

Therefore, we will
    • create sports facilities for all age groups from children to seniors in public spaces, for example fitness courses, table tennis tables, calisthenics facilities, basketball courts, ball courts, skate parks and boules tracks.
    • introduce a "Sport im Park" program based on the Düsseldorf model for all Dortmund residents, which offers non-binding and free sports meetups for untrained and sporty people of all age groups in parks.

Every district of the city should get its own swimming pool:
Strong Approval - We want all children to be able to learn to swim and will make it easier to access swimming lessons. By re-municipalising and taking over the 8 swimming pools of the Sportwelt, we want to ensure that the pools in Dortmund's districts are preserved.

The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos.:
Approval - Dortmund should be lively, safe and diverse even at night. We Greens stand for a nightlife that makes culture, encounters and freedom possible – and we have already achieved a lot: the curfew has been abolished, and a night mayor has been appointed.

But that is just the beginning. We want to further develop Dortmund's nightlife – creatively, in a way that is appropriate for a big city and open to everyone. This includes a club fund to support new spaces and ideas, as well as a friendly review of municipal land for cultural night-time events.

A diverse nightlife is part of a modern city – and an expression of lived freedom.

The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts.:
Strong Approval - Digitalisation is an opportunity that must be shaped responsibly by politicians, so that all people can equally benefit from the positive aspects. For us, the focus is on a future-proof digital infrastructure, free and equal access to the network for all, as well as the protection of our privacy and our personal data, for example through the highest IT security standards.

Therefore, we will, among other things,
    • further expand the digital infrastructure in Dortmund by promoting the comprehensive expansion of broadband Internet and fast mobile networks to enable companies and citizens to access modern technologies from all parts of Dortmund.
    • expand the Dortmund app as an easy-to-use central point of contact for all citizens for citizen service appointments, all applications (including for social benefits), booking systems and reporting defects (defective lighting, illegal waste collections, incorrectly parked vehicles, etc.).
    • expand free internet throughout the inner city and district centres, as well as in all public buildings and public transport, and connect all areas of the Smart City to the Dortmund app.

An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up:
Strong Approval - Young people have a voice – and it should be heard. We Greens want the city of Dortmund to finally become more youth-oriented in its communication. That is why we are advocating for our own youth editorial team to help shape the city’s social media channels.

The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted.:
Approval - Vibrant cities need space for people, not for metal. That is why the GREENS have been campaigning for years to allow outdoor dining on public spaces – even where cars are currently parked.

In 2022, our proposal was rejected by the SPD, CDU, FDP and the Left. But we didn't give up. In 2024, there was a change of heart: under our pressure, the city is finally allowing parking spaces to be made available for outdoor dining.

This shows that persistent GREEN commitment works – for a better quality of life, more joy of life and more space for social interaction.

The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate:
Strong Approval - We Greens have been fighting for years to make participation in Dortmund more inclusive, barrier-free and attractive for all groups. Since 2020, our work has introduced new participation formats such as digital tools, open participation procedures and the establishment of the Youth Commission - with a special focus on accessibility for young people, people with disabilities and marginalized groups. In the future, participation is to be systematically made more accessible, especially for people with language barriers, low education or experiences of discrimination. For this, the Greens are calling for multilingual information, simple language, digital and analog access as well as target group-specific formats.

Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning, for example, in parks or new buildings.:
Strong Approval - We have decided to develop a participation concept for young people.

We want young people in Dortmund to be able to have a say and help shape all decisions that affect them - whether in school, in clubs or in town planning. Young people know their needs best, which is why they are experts in their own interests. We do not want to shape Dortmund for children and young people, but with them.

We want to create a municipal fund for creative projects at schools and youth facilities.

The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics:
Strong Approval - We don’t just want to explain things, we want to actively involve young people in political contexts. Young people should explain to the city what politics should look like.
As the GREENS, we have specifically used and promoted digital formats in the 2020–2025 council period to make political education and participation accessible to young people. The introduction of digital participation tools, online platforms for youth projects, and media support for political processes are examples. School projects, digital workshops, and youth events were also supported to spark political interest.
In the future, we will continue to expand these offers: political education should be designed digitally, interactively, and in a way that is tailored to the target group – for example, through apps, digital participation spaces, and social media formats. The goal is to reach young people where they are – online – and to offer them simple ways to get involved and help shape things.

People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses:
Strong Approval - We have demanded an increase in the inclusion quota in the city, because it has been declining for years. We want the city to try out its own inclusion business and significantly increase the number of training places for young people with disabilities.

Separate homes are to be built for trainees:
Strong Approval - Trainees need not only good companies, but also affordable housing. We Greens have therefore initiated and actively supported a trainee housing project in Dortmund – because training should not fail due to rent.

Our goal is clear: Dortmund should be an attractive training location. For this, we want to further develop and expand the trainee housing as a safe, affordable place to live and learn.

Those who decide on an apprenticeship deserve support and good conditions from the start.

Dortmund is to tighten regulations on social housing construction in order to create affordable living space:
Strong Approval - We have decided on a 30% quota for social housing.

Housing is a basic right. That is why we are committed to ensuring that all people in Dortmund can find affordable housing and do not have to worry about losing their homes. We must especially support those who, for various reasons, have difficulty finding a place on the general housing market. Our goal is that rent should not exceed 30% of available income.

We will expand the quota for social housing to 40% for new development plans and will additionally offer at least 10% of the homes in each new development area in the so-called price-capped segment, i.e. with square meter prices between social rent and asking rent, which is secured by a town planning agreement.

The basic tax in Dortmund is to rise.:
Neutral - We have implemented the property tax reform without burdening citizens.

We will evaluate the municipal revenue from property tax, business tax, dog tax, packaging tax and other taxes and enforce their collection.

We want to introduce property tax C for land mobilisation, which also includes a property tax on unbuilt land in order to curb land speculation.

Offers for young people are to be created in every district.:
Strong Approval - To make Dortmund an attractive city for young people, we will:
 
• Establish and upgrade more self-managed youth centres in all districts of the city together with young people
• Modernise existing youth leisure facilities and provide them with up-to-date equipment
• Create more alcohol-free places where young people can spend time together in groups in the evenings
• Ensure open spaces and areas in every district of the city to promote creative, sporting and musical activities, including rehearsal rooms for young bands.
• Promote synergies in the use of space by encouraging schools, kindergartens, churches, local community centres, etc. to make their spaces available to clubs, youth groups, initiatives, etc.

The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations:
Strong Approval - Urban spaces belong to everyone – not just a few. We Greens are committed to making access to public spaces and urban infrastructure easier, more transparent and fairer. Whether for youth groups, initiatives or cultural projects: those who show commitment should not be held back by bureaucracy or hurdles. Spaces must be able to be used – without bureaucracy and fairly. After all, a lively city needs space for ideas.

The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures:
Strong Approval - Good ideas need resources. That is why we, the GREENS, are committed to ensuring that Dortmund continues to successfully apply for funding in the future – for social projects, climate protection, education, culture and youth.

The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language.:
Strong Approval - Multilingual and simple communication is already being strengthened. On our initiative, the city's website can now be automatically translated into other languages.

More public litter bins are to be installed in the city:
Strong Approval - We are producing more and more waste in Dortmund and are thereby wasting valuable resources. We want to promote a change in thinking and create the conditions for products to be used longer and more often, repaired, used in parts or have their components recycled. At the same time, we want to reduce the amount of waste that is illegally disposed of in the city or in nature. We want to do the following:
    • Make deposit systems for coffee-to-go cups mandatory in Dortmund.
    • Work completely with reusable systems at large events in the city.
    • Support the introduction of reusable systems at the weekly markets, the Christmas market, other markets and fairs in the city and promote them through relief from garbage fees.
    • Continue to demand the introduction of a municipal packaging tax according to the Tübingen model, which makes the switch to reusable systems attractive for the catering industry.
    • Strive for the establishment of a second-hand goods store with an attached repair café or an upcycling workshop.
    • Promote exchange markets for used products such as clothing, furnishings,

Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces:
Strong Approval - We have initiated drinking water offers at schools.

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:
Strong Approval - Trees bind CO2 and fine dust in the air, strengthen the heat resistance of the city through shade and natural coolness, ensure the desegregation of areas, offer nesting places for birds and enhance the city and landscape image. 

We will 
    • identify needs for improving the stock of street trees and street greenery and in particular make proposals for streets without any greenery in residential areas. 
    • replant dead trees on existing tree islands, replant empty tree islands and set up new tree islands in order to achieve the already agreed target of an additional 1000 trees. 
    • select location-appropriate and climate-resistant trees 
    • preserve and maintain old and significant city trees. 
    • take into account the planting of trees when designing new streets. 
    • plant a Tiny Forest (Mikrowald) on a remaining area in a densely populated residential or commercial area as a model experiment for a climate adaptation measure.

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Strong Approval - The expansion of solar power on roofs has started and the obligation for new urban buildings has been introduced.

For the energy transition, we need the expansion of renewable energy. We need to use the municipal opportunities to advise and promote and to create the framework conditions and thus to lead by example. For this we will

• as quickly as possible, install photovoltaic systems on all suitable municipal roofs and facades, i.e. on administrative buildings, schools, childcare facilities, sports halls, event venues or hospitals.
• cover parking spaces, which cannot be built on elsewhere, with solar systems and green roofs, in order to use the areas for energy generation and for E-charging stations and at the same time create a roof.
• advise operators of agricultural land on the use of agri-PV, i.e. photovoltaic systems over the areas, and promote implementation.
• concentrate on solar power plants on open spaces, such as landfills, contaminated land, conversion or fallow land as well as along infrastructure axes.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - Access to a clean, safe toilet is a basic need and a matter of dignity. We Greens have put the issue of public toilets on the agenda time and again because it plays a big role in the lives of many people.

We demand: More barrier-free, free and 24-hour toilets must be created in public buildings and public spaces – clean, safe and usable for all genders.

An inclusive city thinks of everyone, even where it is often overlooked.

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
Approval - We advocate a security concept that takes the diversity of Dortmund seriously. A city is safe when everyone feels safe in it, regardless of where they come from, how they look or how they live. Security does not begin with blue lights, but with good lighting, accessible contact persons, respectful behavior and reliable support in everyday life. This requires a police force that works close to the citizens and transparently, an order service that helps and supports sensitively, and municipal structures that offer protection without stigmatizing. It needs safe spaces as well as trust, accessibility as well as a clear stance against violence.

All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism:
Strong Approval - Discrimination must not be tolerated in any authority. That is why we Greens want to make anti-discrimination training mandatory for all employees. Only in this way can we reduce prejudices and ensure a respectful and fair administration.

We are also pushing for the establishment of an anti-discrimination staff unit in the administration. This unit should coordinate anti-racist measures and serve as a central point of contact for those affected.

In addition, we are strengthening our initiative for further training in dealing with people in exceptional psychological situations. This will create more awareness, competence and protection - for all those who are dependent on support.

In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created.:
Strong Approval - We will continue to support safe spaces such as the Sunrise Youth Centre and the queer group of the Forum Jugend. As called for in the LSBTIQ action plan we initiated, we want to strengthen and qualify youth clubs in every district of the city to be open drop-in centres for queer youth.

Our vision is a city where everyone can live without fear of discrimination, with equal opportunities and the freedom to develop individually. Racism, antisemitism, queerphobia and other forms of discrimination have no place in Dortmund.

We are fighting for a city where queer people not only live safely, but can also actively participate and develop. For this, safe spaces must be expanded, political structures strengthened and queer organisations specifically supported. It is particularly important to us to focus on LSBTIQ* youth, who are often confronted with social pressure and prejudices in their search for identity. That is why we will take specific measures to further promote equality, participation and acceptance of LSBTIQ* people in Dortmund.

We will permanently support the SCHLAU project to conduct workshops in

Drop-in centres are to be set up in every district for gay youths:
Strong Approval - We will continue to implement and develop the LSBTIQ action plan that we initiated against the discrimination of LSBTIQ* people. We will push forward the demand for contact points in all districts by qualifying existing youth clubs and centres. It is important to us that all youth facilities are able to be prepared for the concerns of queer youth. We will continue to provide financial and structural support to SLADO and other LSBTIQ* initiatives and queer associations that make an important contribution to the acceptance and support of LSBTIQ* people, but are dependent on voluntary work and require sustainable support.

Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness:
Strong Approval - We want to offer training for teachers on dealing with diversity and preventing discrimination. To this end, we want to continue to promote and strengthen the SCHLAU project in order to also reach employees in schools and youth facilities.

Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund:
Strong Approval - We, the Greens, are committed to designing school from the child’s perspective and to promoting all students in Dortmund in the best possible way, so that no one is left behind. Inclusion and individual support must not just be buzzwords, but must become a lived reality in everyday school life. We want a school system that is oriented towards the needs of children and not vice versa.

Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free:
Strong Approval - Youth and leisure facilities must be inclusive and accessible to all, i.e. without barriers.

More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people:
Strong Approval - Holiday offers must be open and accessible to everyone. We have worked to ensure that this requirement is met in the city's holiday offers.

Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices:
Strong Approval - We Greens have already significantly strengthened the transition from school to work, and we will consistently continue on this path. Because every young person deserves a real chance for a successful start to working life.

Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way:
Strong Approval - With our budget proposals, we have explicitly supported the visit of extra-curricular learning locations with financial resources. Our goal is that all young people can participate in the offers during the school trip free of charge.

We have also replaced the Dortmund Pass with the Dortmund Card and have thus enabled more families to use municipal offers free of charge or at a reduced price.

We want to counteract child and youth poverty by improving early childhood support and expanding care offers, especially in disadvantaged districts, as well as creating free sports offers and supporting the necessary equipment.

We will ensure that the funds for education and participation are more easily and less bureaucratically accessible.
