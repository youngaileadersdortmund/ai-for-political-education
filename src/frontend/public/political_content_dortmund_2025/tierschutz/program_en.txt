Election program of the (Animal Welfare Party) Municipal Election on September 14, 2025 in Dortmund Successes of the past legislative period With heart and mind for Dortmund - Balance sheet and outlook of the Animal Welfare Party The legislative period 2020 to 2025, after our first entry into the city council, was characterized for the party Mensch Umwelt Tierschutz - Animal Welfare Party in Dortmund by groundbreaking successes that have sustainably improved life in our city.
Our consistent work in the city council and committees, in cooperation with our faction Die Linke+, has been reflected in over 50 motions and inquiries, which made central progress in the areas of animal welfare, environmental policy and social justice possible.
Improved animal welfare: Concrete help for animals in Dortmund We successfully advocated for financial support for the pigeon aid and the hedgehog station.
This means that the care of injured or sick wild animals is now better secured.
Especially for the management of city pigeons, which is often overlooked in urban deb This is a long overdue step for the approximately 30 employees.
A strong signal for animal protection in Dortmund!
A particularly great success before the end of the current legislative period is the introduction of a driving ban for mowing robots.
This motion, which we introduced, was passed in July 2025 by all council factions with the abstention of the AfD.
This regulation will hopefully help to save the lives of many hedgehogs and other small animals in the city area.
Environmental protection: Innovative projects for a greener Dortmund.
We have also made the concept of Tiny Forests possible through a pilot project in Dortmund.
These small, intensively planted forests contribute to air purification, promote biodiversity and offer recreation for citizens.
In addition, a recommendation was made in the committee for climate protection, the environment, urban design and housing to plant a tree for every newborn child in Dortmund.
The motion of the faction provides that the families receive information about “their” tree and this is integrated into digital offers.
The administration is now to examine suitable locations and link the concept with existing planting programs.
Social justice: Vote for the weak Our work, however, goes far beyond animal and environmental protection.
In the current legislative period, we have always campaigned for a fairer, participatory society.
For example, our motion for barrier-free path barriers was unanimously adopted.
The aim is to design barriers in the future in such a way that wheelchair users, people with prams, cyclists or people with other mobility impairments can easily access nature.
The retrofitting or replacement during renovations is cost-effective and can be implemented in a practical way.
This shows that our motto "Give a voice to the voiceless" is consistently implemented.
Our party has made a decisive contribution to Dortmund becoming part of the nationwide PORTAL network.
This is a significant step through which people are to come together across national borders.
We are waiting for the start of the work here.
With these successes mentioned by way of example, we are going into the local elections in 2025 with determination.
Together with the citizens, we want to continue to shape Dortmund: socially, ecologically, animal-friendly and climate-friendly.
Support us in continuing the path we have taken and in tackling new challenges.
Foreword to the Municipal Election Programme The PARTY HUMAN ENVIRONMENT ANIMAL PROTECTION - Animal Protection Party is once again taking part in the municipal elections in Dortmund.
In recent years, we have been able to establish ourselves as a firm political force in the city and have set numerous impulses for a socially just, ecological and future-oriented municipal policy.
We represent well-founded positions not only in classic animal protection, but also in central areas of society such as climate and environmental protection, social justice, mobility, education, citizen participation and human rights.
In doing so, we pursue a policy that is not aimed at short-term effects, but thinks long-term and creates sustainable solutions.
Holistically, reflectively and future-oriented.
Many people no longer feel represented by the established parties because ecological and social concerns have to take a back seat to a policy driven by the pursuit In contrast, we consistently stand up for human rights, biodiversity and climate protection.
Even though there is a rollback to group-based hostility in various forms in large parts of society, we see elsewhere many people who stand in solidarity for the weaker and want to live peacefully and fairly together.
We want to support their efforts through our politics.
We stand for progressive thinking and action and for politics for our children and not at their expense.
We want to achieve this in all political areas, not just in the area of animal protection, as the party name might suggest at first glance.
We want to make this clear to our fellow citizens in our election program for Dortmund.
Because more than ever, a political orientation is needed that acts far-sightedly, holistically, self-critically and reflectively.
A political agenda that is not limited to the next election period.
On the following pages we describe the things we stand for in the next legislative period, because we believe that these are the points that are urgent and at the same time receive the least attention from the big parties.
Numerous chapters have been developed jointly with the Klimaliste NRW.
We would like to thank you very much for the wonderful and productive cooperation!
Our election program is divided into three areas: people, environment and animals.
The order does not represent a weighting, but shows that all three areas are deeply intertwined for us and are treated with equal priority.

54 As PARTY HUMAN ENVIRONMENT ANIMAL WELFARE we see humans as part of nature.
We are neither above nor below our environment.
We take the biodiversity and climate crisis seriously and refuse to react to it with technocratic optimism.
There will be no redeeming technology that can undo the damage that has already been done.
Only a holistic change in society will make a harmonious coexistence of humans with each other and with nature possible.
This does not require hard cuts in our real standard of living, but rather an end to climate-damaging luxury consumption, which only a minority can afford anyway.
We denounce the persistence of a throwaway society and demand and promote more respect for the goods produced, for the environment, for animals and for people.
We demand and promote a respectful coexistence with each other, regardless of origin and financial situation.
We reject the capitalist worldview of humans as interchangeable goods.
That is why we clearly and unequivocally stand up for social, ecological and intergenerational justice and fight against any form of discriminatory thinking.
We demand a society that is self-critical about itself and its past, that is aware of its responsibility to the younger generation and that resolutely fights against any current that infringes on the inviolable dignity of humans.
Addressing social challenges We are aware that we cannot solve the major social problems in many places around the world here in Dortmund.
However, we are firmly convinced that we can have a positive influence both locally and globally.
Following the motto “Think globally, act locally”, we want to sensitize our fellow citizens to the possibilities for long-term sustainable action through action days, awareness campaigns and similar measures.
However, we also see the real conflicts here in Dortmund, with which our fellow citizens feel confronted on a daily basis.
That is why we clearly focus on promoting those in need, socially disadvantaged, innocently marginalized groups, minorities and people in society who are hardly But Dortmund can take the lead in dealing with actual drug use within the city by carrying out studies and model projects.
We demand model projects that are based on scientific facts.
We want to create new concepts for regulated and scientifically monitored studies for the distribution of drugs to adults.
Positive experiences, such as those from Switzerland, with state-controlled heroin distribution or the decriminalisation of drugs in Portugal, show a way of dealing with drugs that respects and protects human dignity.
That is why we demand model projects that show a new way and bring together positive experiences, so that more pressure can be exerted at federal level.
Because drug use is here and real, we vehemently reject any denial, trivialisation of the situation, any differentiation of consumers, any handling of the situation that consists only of reprisals.
New ways are urgently needed for the current situation.
And in the long term, the best prevention against harmful drug use is social justice, fact-based education, a society free of all forms of discrimination!
It may be a long way until then, which is why we demand a massive expansion of municipal addiction counselling and support services.
Although a second one is planned in the Rheinische Straße in autumn 2025, this is not enough for a city as large as Dortmund.
We demand a decentralised and needs-based distribution of easily accessible consumption areas in order to even come close to the real situation.
We demand campaigns against the stigmatisation of drug users and a fact-based clarification of drugs and their users in order to banish the discriminatory image of the “junkie” from people’s minds.
In addition to our demand for a new approach to drug consumption, we also demand a massive expansion of support services and strengthening of the local organisations and associations.
We also demand the so-called drug checking.
This is an offer in which drugs are tested for quality, purity and adulterants in a mobile laboratory before party events.
People who want to consume these drugs must be provided with the means and knowledge to do so in a protected environment.
That is why we want drug checking to be introduced here in Dortmund so that people have the opportunity to find out what they are consuming before party events, to check it for contamination and purity in order to choose a safe dosage.
We demand that regular and mandatory addiction counselling and education by specialists with age-appropriate content should take place in all schools.
The resilience of children should be promoted and strengthened in kindergarten.
From the 1st grade onwards, a combination of resilience promotion and addiction counselling should take place.
From secondary school onwards, addiction counselling and school social work should be part of everyday life and should be available to teachers, students and parents.
Project weeks/days and regular education and counselling within the lessons (biology, social studies etc.) together with other health-promoting topics and violence prevention should be offered.
Addiction counselling in the workplace: We demand that in companies with more than 1000 employees, occupational addiction counselling is mandatory.
This shows that early detection is essential for employees to maintain their health.
Adult support Unfortunately, adult support is still stigmatised in many social circles.
Comments such as “Don’t act like that” to “Pull yourself together”, are still common today when adults are in difficult phases or emergencies.
Domestic violence, in particular, is often played down or does not even come to light.
That is why we want: • Expansion of women's shelters • Establishment of men's shelters in Dortmund, cooperation with the Freiraum project, as with existing men's shelters in Cologne and Düsseldorf • Support offers for perpetrators for prevention and rehabilitation • Establishment of safe havens for non-cis people • Expansion of municipal support structures, especially the social-psychiatric • Concept for combating post-Covid consequences and design of strategies for similar cases in the future Homelessness assistance - Housing First and defensive architecture Housing First stands for a concept in which homeless people are given a home unconditionally, without prerequisites such as in previous support systems.
We demand a new municipal way of thinking in dealing with people who live on the street.
We vehemently reject the old and inhumane way of thinking "not registered here, not our problem".
It is a matter of integrating new concepts that have already achieved considerable success elsewhere into urban life.
We demand close cooperation with already The apartment is the basis for stabilization, social participation and health.
This approach has proven successful internationally, for example in Finland and Berlin, and must finally be effectively implemented in Dortmund.
The council has already decided in 2021 to provide 20 apartments for Housing First in a pilot project.
But to date, hardly any apartments have actually been made available.
We strongly criticize this delay: If over 500 municipal apartments are available in the reserve program, it is incomprehensible why homeless people continue to be excluded.
The city must act immediately according to need and reach people on the street in a low-threshold manner.
That is why we demand: • a significant expansion and further opening of the Housing First program beyond the existing pilot project: at least 100 apartments must be made available in the coming years, also through DOGEWO21, the municipal reserve program, or through targeted purchase of apartments.
• social work support as a permanent component of the project to promote stability, health and social participation.
• the renunciation of discriminatory criteria such as Schufa certificates by municipal and subsidized housing companies • Sensitization of staff and helpers in dealing with homeless LGBTQIA+ people.
• Integration of existing support structures into municipal housing funds.
Housing is a human right!
We are fighting for a city in which no one has to live on the street!
Defensive architecture: We want to work towards the city of Dortmund abandoning measures that can be classified as so-called “defensive architecture” (also known as homeless architecture).
Defensive architecture refers to building measures that are ultimately “...installed in public spaces under the guise of security, in order to prevent their use by certain groups of people or for certain purposes...” (www.deutschlandfunk.de).
This can include benches with armrests in the middle or a complete lack of seating, uneven or raised surfaces (even on walls), which make it difficult to walk or sit, bicycle racks under bridges, barriers and/or fences.
They not only exclude marginalized groups such as homeless people, but also make it difficult for people with disabilities, the elderly and the sick to use them.
Even in Dortmund, there are such implementations.
We will make them visible.
Help for LGBTQIA+ Persons Unfortunately, people from the LGBTQIA+ community still experience discrimination and hatred in everyday life.
We stand against any form of discrimination and hatred.
That is why we want a Dortmund in which no one is discriminated against because of their gender identity or sexuality.
That is why we want: • Municipal action days against discrimination of LGBTQIA+ persons • Increased awareness at schools and educational institutions • A city that clearly identifies with its diverse population • A united front against any form of discrimination • To oppose the relativization of discriminatory thinking.
The situation of LGBTQIA+ persons in many parts of the world is dramatic.
In many countries, even homosexuality is still punishable.
We consider this state of affairs to be unacceptable and want to enable LGBTQIA+ persons to find asylum in Germany or Dortmund from political persecution and discrimination, which often also endangers their lives.
We demand that Dortmund in the German City Council fights for an international procedure that offers these people the opportunity to put down roots here In addition to the possibility of granting them asylum here, we or our federal party want the federal government to make a strong case for the rights of LGBTQIA+ people and to represent them diplomatically.
Protecting the right to asylum – enabling integration We defend the right to asylum enshrined in the constitution (Article 16 of the Basic Law).
As a democratic society, we see it as our responsibility to provide protection to people who are fleeing life-threatening situations, as stipulated by the European Convention on Human Rights.
We therefore welcome the council resolution in which Dortmund declares solidarity with the Seebrücke initiative and expresses its willingness to accept additional people.
The acceptance of people who have refused to fight in the war is of particular urgency to us.
Furthermore, we demand: • The abolition of the discriminatory payment card for refugees.
• The transfer to a clear, decentralised accommodation with privacy.
• The protection of children's rights (enforcement of the right to education, including for children in the state institution).
• The expansion of language and integration courses as well as political • Early integration into educational institutions and the labour market in cooperation with local companies, with special consideration of those sectors that have a shortage of young people, such as nursing and crafts.
• Improved medical care for people without secure residence status.
• Expansion of psychological and social support services for traumatised people.
• Promotion of civil society engagement for refugees.
Prostitution - Nordic Model Prostitution is not a regular job, but often an expression of structural inequality, poverty and violence.
The problem of the Nordmarkt in Dortmund, where cases of exploitative prostitution, child prostitution and human trafficking have been documented, is particularly well known.
The Nordic Model (also known as the “sex purchase ban”) offers an approach that: • Punishes buyers, not prostitutes.
• Supports exit programmes.
• More effectively combats human trafficking and forced prostitution.
That is why we are campaigning for: 1.
Introduction of the Nordic Model - criminal prosecution of the clients, not the prostitutes.
- Offering counselling/therapy to convicted clients.
- Education campaigns about the consequences of prostitution (physical/psychological violence, human trafficking).
- Cooperation with the police and social services to break down exploitation structures.
- The city of Dortmund must officially support the Nordic Model and exert pressure at state and federal level.
2.
Protection of women and minors - targeted raids against pimps and human traffickers.
- Anonymous reporting channels for those affected (for example via street work or digital platforms).
- Immediate help and accommodation for women and girls in need (cooperation with women's shelters).
- Drafting of a media education concept/media driver's license - Education about the so-called "loverboy method" in schools, generally early education about consensual sex (consent) 3.
- Creating exit programs and alternatives - Financial aid for those affected who want to leave prostitution.
- Vocational qualification and psychosocial support.
- Cooperation with NGOs such as Sisters e.V., Netzwerk Ella, Jadwiga, Terre des Femmes, Netzwerk LINKE for a world without prostitution, Zonta -Dortmund.
- Offering a low-threshold therapy program 4.
- Raising awareness in society - School workshops about the reality of prostitution (not a "liberal career choice", but often violence and exploitation).
- Campaigns against the romanticisation of prostitution (for example "Pimp culture" in music and media).
Why Dortmund in particular?
The Nordmarkt as a focal point: There have been reports of child prostitution and forced prostitutes from Eastern Europe for years.
Human trafficking: Many women are lured to Dortmund under false pretences and then exploited.
Worldwide, 60% of those affected by human trafficking are girls and women; in Germany, it is even 95.2% of those affected.
Prostitution is not a job like any other.
It involves penetration of body orifices and is a profound violation of physical and sexual self-determination.
Many of those affected can only endure this process through psychological dissociation (dissociation), a common reaction to traumatic experiences.
Prostitution reduces women in particular to objects of sexual availability, reinforces existing gender inequalities and makes bodies and intimacy into commodities, a consumer good that is subject to the rules of the capitalist market.
It is a system that drives poor women, migrant women and victims of abuse into exploitation.
Dortmund must take responsibility here and can no longer turn a blind eye.
The Nordic model offers a way out: it takes the demand out of the equation, decriminalises those affected and creates real opportunities for exit.
Three-quarters of all care cases are cared for by relatives, without whom our over-stretched care system would collapse.
We want to draw attention to this fact and create awareness of it in society.
Of course, we want to offer better and more extensive support to carers, with which they can shape their everyday lives.
That is why we demand: • Expansion of the staff of the Dortmund Social Office • Improvement of the support services for carers, for example Self-help groups, free seminars and further education opportunities in the areas of care and support for care dependents • Better recording and support of children and young That is why we demand: • An upgrade of integration support through a mandatory training measure that imparts the necessary pedagogical knowledge • Municipal cooperation days with providers of facilities that provide people with disabilities with local educational and school facilities Unfortunately, the city does not yet reflect the image of a barrier-free society that we demand.
That is why we are fighting for a Dortmund that clearly positions itself for barrier-free access and against discrimination against people with physical and mental disabilities.
All too often, sidewalks are only half-heartedly flattened to the streets, a circumstance that repeatedly leads to problems for people in wheelchairs or with other walking difficulties.
Malfunctioning escalators and elevators at light rail stops repeatedly lead to unnecessary problems for people who are dependent on them.
We demand: • Increased step-free flattening of sidewalks towards the street side.
• Shorter service and maintenance intervals to guarantee the function of escalators and especially elevators!
• As many barrier-free public transport stops as possible in the city area by 2030.
o If barrier-free designs are not feasible or only very difficult to implement, we still demand • New buildings must be designed to be barrier-free, with a view to our ageing society.
• Digital barrier-free access must be promoted, but at the same time the freedom of choice to use things in analogue form (for example in writing, by post) must be maintained.
Anti-discrimination We want a Dortmund free of all discrimination and see the city itself as responsible for working towards this.
That is why the promotion of projects against discrimination and projects on a self-initiative basis is one of our central demands.
In Dortmund, no one should be discriminated against on the basis of nationality, gender, gender identity, sexuality, faith, skin colour or appearance.
We demand a clear and unambiguous position in Dortmund against discrimination of any kind!
Affordable housing in a liveable city Housing is a basic right.
In Dortmund, the rent is too expensive for many people.
This particularly affects people with little money, families, pensioners, trainees, students and refugees.
But the middle class is also suffering from the high costs.
Instead of capping rents, housing assistance is being increased and the taxpayer is subsidizing the much too high rents.
No one should be afraid of losing their home or not being able to afford a new one.
We are committed to a social housing policy that prevents displacement and secures access to safe, affordable housing.
The completely exorbitant rental costs must be reduced, at least capped.
Ownership is a responsibility and must serve the common good.
Even the expropriation of housing companies is possible for the common good according to Article 14 of the Basic Law and should be considered.
Our demands: • At least 20% of communal housing in every new construction project.
• Consistent use of the municipal pre-emption right, so that speculation with land and buildings is not possible.
• Anyone who leaves housing vacant for longer despite being required to apply for it can be fined up to 50,000 euros in Dortmund.
The Dortmund housing protection ordinance must be consistently implemented.
Vacancy tax after six months and mandatory progressive rent reduction in the case of vacancy after six months.
• Conversion of empty office buildings into energy-saving homes.
• Temporary modular homes on vacant land – as a pragmatic solution for students, trainees and refugees.
For a livable city we also demand: • Preservation and renovation of public swimming pools, playgrounds and leisure facilities.
• Expansion of green spaces and green strips in the street.
• More dog meadows in all city districts.
Leash obligation in nature reserves, in park-like areas and on children's playgrounds.
• Renaturation of sealed vacant land and return to public use.
• Municipal subsidiaries should be oriented towards the common good instead of profit.
• Payment according to collective agreements for all employees of municipal companies.
Good living and good life should not be a question of income.
It should be a matter of course.
Free public toilets People from Asian countries such as Japan or Korea are surprised that there are no free public toilets in Germany.
What is a matter of course in other countries seems impossible and meets with resistance here.
Disproportionate wear and tear and contamination, as well as high cleaning costs are often used as counterarguments.
The socially just aspect is ignored.
The lack of public toilets that are open all the time, however, restricts the stay at certain places for some groups of people, not only for the homeless.
This also includes people with disabilities, the elderly and the sick, as well as pregnant women and people with bladder weakness.
Public toilets are not always available in places or shops that can be visited publicly.
Certain groups of people are even denied access.
Thus, the human urge becomes a business.
We demand the construction of sufficient public toilets in the city and all district centres, as well as popular destinations.
We go one step further and demand that these are free of charge.
Effective sound protection The term “dilapidated sound protection” is already a euphemism in many places.
In many areas of Dortmund, effective noise protection is completely lacking.
We demand a comprehensive revision of the noise protection concept for the entire city area.
In view of the massive noise pollution that many citizens are exposed to, a comparison with other cities and countries with a functioning noise protection system is downright embarrassing.
We therefore demand: • A new municipal concept for noise reduction • more retroactive sound protection • If possible: always roundabouts instead of traffic lights in new roads and redesigns • Green waves for cars without impairing cyclists • More green arrows for right turns • Modern sound protection at the railway tracks • Tightening of the sound protection guidelines For Europe, against all extremism We see Dortmund as a city of Europe, which stands up for the European fundamental values.
Which values the advantages of a European togetherness, respects and preserves them.
It And that is why we reject all behaviour and thinking that aims to discriminate, harm, defame and relativise where there is nothing to relativise!
We stand for a society that rejects all discriminatory behaviour, that does not tolerate any kind of discrimination, that holds together against the right with determination.
We believe that culture and tradition are possible without any kind of discrimination and without any kind of extremism.
Cultures and traditions have never been a constant in the history of humanity, but a multitude of variables.
We stand for a reflective society.
A society that rejects all discriminatory behaviour and stands up to it.
Even if some behaviour and thinking is deeply rooted in cultural contexts, as soon as it discriminates and cuts into the dignity of human beings, it has lost its place in our society!
We believe that values, cultures and traditions can develop.
We want to work for this development and fight for it, because it is worth fighting for a world free of any kind of discrimination!
We stand against all currents and all attempts to play down the time of National Socialism.
It is degrading to human beings when such ideas are tolerated or accepted.
We reject any trivialization and clearly distance ourselves from anti-Semitism and other racist expressions of any kind.
We also demand the subsidization of museums that provide comprehensive information about the horrors of National Socialism and also offer related exhibitions.
This is intended to create free educational opportunities.
We are committed to both educating people about the dangers of right-wing extremist thinking and to a factual and differentiated discussion of Islam.
We resolutely reject Islamophobia and any form of discrimination based on religion or origin.
A clear distinction between Islam as a religion and the political extremism of Islamism is essential.
Only through thorough education can prejudices be reduced and misunderstandings avoided that equate peacefully practiced faith with violence and terror.
For us, violence in any form is unacceptable.
We stand for an open, tolerant and enlightened society.
Social and ecological understanding We support the municipal promotion of projects that combine social and ecological aspects.
Such initiatives create meaningful spaces for encounters, strengthen the sense of community and at the same time make a contribution to environmental and animal protection.
We are committed to promoting contact between children and animals in day care centers, children's clinics and primary schools.
In particular, animal-assisted therapies should be used as a supplement to existing educational and therapeutic concepts in order to specifically support and stabilize children in difficult situations.
We would like to encourage schools to enter into partnerships with institutions such as the Dortmund Animal Welfare Center, the Hedgehog Center or the Amphibian Protection Association.
Through joint actions, mutual visits and the development of joint projects, students should be sensitized to animal protection and actively involved.
Municipal recognition or symbolic compensation for expenses can additionally support this commitment.
We also demand the integration of school gardens.
The voluntary commitment of students can be supported by "Dortmunder Kohle" (see page 21).
Donate places and waste collection days for more sustainability After the great success of bookshelves throughout the city, the city should definitely establish places, together with associations, communities and private actors, where citizens can donate or deposit things to be given away.
These should be distributed decentrally throughout the entire city area and protected from the weather, i.e.
covered.
Volunteer cooperations in the neighborhoods should ensure that these places are regularly maintained.
Until now, household items to be given away are often deposited in glass containers, but this solution has numerous disadvantages.
We also advocate for regular garbage collection days, as many people in Dortmund are not able to bring their things to be disposed of to the recycling yards and for smaller quantities, it is not worthwhile to order a collection by the EDG.
On the other hand, we have major problems with illegal garbage dumps in many places in Dortmund.
We advocate for new concepts that improve cleanliness in our city, that punish the creation of illegal garbage dumps and the associated environmental hazards even more severely and that better identify those responsible.
However, this should be accompanied by multilingual educational and information campaigns for all age groups.
Actions such as Clean- Advertising ban in front of school buildings We demand a restriction on advertising in front of school buildings.
Moving advertising images are particularly disturbing and impair the concentration of pupils.
It is not acceptable that schools are obliged to provide education for sustainable development while children are directly confronted with overstimulating advertising in front of the school, which impairs their free and self-determined decision-making and their learning success.
Child and youth welfare We see a growing need for assistance for all age groups.
We demand a comprehensive concept that does not leave any group of people out and does not discriminate against anyone.
In the area of child and youth welfare, we demand: • Increase in the number of staff at the youth office and other help centres • More review and transparency within the structures of the youth offices and an improvement in communication between the youth office and police authorities • Expansion of municipal child and youth psychiatric clinics and support services for children and young people who require care • Urban planning and traffic policy measures must take into account the needs of children and young people.
To reduce noise and increase safety, we demand a 30 km/h speed limit throughout That is why we are advocating for a tangible appreciation and stronger support of voluntary work.
We want the value of voluntary work in Dortmund to be more visible.
This can be achieved through city action days in cooperation with voluntary work providers, targeted public relations work and a stronger appreciation of the contribution of people who are active in voluntary work for the common good.
That is why we are calling for: 1.
Further development of the voluntary work card: The voluntary work card introduced in 2019 is a first step.
We want: o a reduction in the minimum requirement from five to four hours per week (similar to the regulation in Halle/Saale), o the removal of bureaucratic hurdles when applying, o a right of participation for associations and organizations in the assessment of whether a task meets the requirements.

Special parking permits and public transport subsidies for voluntary workers: We demand that the city of Dortmund examines whether special parking permits can be issued for non-profit associations in the city area.
These permits should allow free parking at the respective deployment location.
In addition, it should be examined whether travel Cities like Flensburg already show that such models are feasible.
There, volunteers are allowed to use fee-based or time-limited parking spaces free of charge while carrying out their activities.
The administration and internal allocation of parking passes should be organized by the associations.
No one should perceive voluntary work as “wasted time”, but as an essential, supportive part of public life.
This requires visible recognition, including practical relief in everyday life.
For an ecological, local economy We stand for an ecological, locally anchored economy as part of a lively urban culture.
Therefore, we demand a strengthening of the regional economy under ecological aspects.
We need a new economic thinking in our society, away from the image of humans as interchangeable goods, towards the idea that the economy can serve everyone.
The economy should not be an end in itself.
The annual increase in gross domestic product as a central political goal is incompatible with climate and species protection.
Instead of a constantly growing economy, we demand that we recognize the limits set by nature.
We are fighting for a profound transformation towards an ecological economy that creates sustainable, long-term jobs and promotes companies that integrate themselves into the urban society.
The well-being of all living beings and the preservation of our natural living conditions must be at the center of this.
Therefore, we are committed to strengthening the local and regional economy from an ecological perspective.
Employment is an important aspect, but not the all-deciding one in our lives.
We want to encourage people to see the economy as a part of society and not as a dominating factor.
Profit-making must not be at the expense of nature and people.
In order to achieve profound changes where money, power and strong, long-established structures currently gather, innovative economic policy instruments are needed.
Here we rely on the introduction of the common good economy in all municipal institutions and on the introduction of a municipal regional currency that ensures that the added value remains in the region and thereby avoids unnecessary emissions.
This concept also concerns the municipal subsidiaries as well as all educational institutions and the TU Dortmund.
As Specifically, we demand: • A lower business tax for all commercial businesses that operate sustainably and climate-neutrally • Introduction of a municipal packaging tax for the effective reduction of packaging waste.
• Introduction of the common good balance sheet and regional currency • We advocate for the preservation and targeted strengthening of owner-managed businesses, local shops and non-profit structures.
These secure social participation, ecological standards and regional value creation.
• Large corporations and chains that dictate their prices through the exploitation of people, animals and the environment can no longer be given preferential treatment.
• As an innovative instrument for promoting local cycles and civic engagement, we propose the introduction of a municipal regional currency “Dortmunder Kohle” based on the model of the city of Ghent in Belgium.
Such a currency can provide impetus for a fair and resilient city economy in a wide range of areas, from nature conservation to voluntary work.
Municipal currency “Dortmunder Kohle” The municipal regional currency mentioned above, under the proposed working title “Dortmunder Kohle”, can be designed as a printed means of payment or as a digital currency with For example, five percent at the beginning, in "Dortmunder Kohle".
This can further stimulate the regional economy and strengthen the identification of citizens with their city.
Large chain stores are intentionally excluded in order to focus on local added value and support the establishment of local businesses.
With this initiative, we want to keep the purchasing power in Dortmund, appreciate ecological and social services and make the city more communal, greener, fairer and more livable.
Start-up location for sustainability.
The incentive of lower business taxes should be created for sustainable, socially just and ethical shops such as organic shops, organic (vegan) agriculture, fruit and vegetable basket deliveries, second-hand shops, shops for ecological and morally acceptable clothing, vegan restaurants, fair trade shops, unpackaged shops, repair shops, filling stations for E- and green hydrogen cars, etc.
Already ongoing initiatives of economic development such as "Greenhouse Ruhr" must be further promoted and expanded.
Security, but without instrumentalization.
Security is a basic human need.
Unfortunately, We reject this outright.
We are convinced that repression, surveillance and the construction of facial recognition software are not sustainable solutions for a secure coexistence.
Real security is created where the causes of violence and crime are effectively combated.
This includes, in particular, discrimination, social exclusion, hatred, prejudice, sexism, racism and economic inequality.
As long as these structural problems exist, measures such as increased police presence or digital surveillance are mere symptom treatment.
Therefore, we demand a prevention-oriented security concept that is based on social cohesion, social justice and real problem solving.
The police should primarily concentrate on the clarification and prosecution of serious crimes, not on the control of marginalized groups or the criminalization of drug consumption.
An important step in this regard is the decriminalization and regulated legalization of drugs.
A state-controlled distribution would deprive criminal structures of their business basis, reduce drug crime and relieve the police and judiciary.
These freed-up resources could be used sensibly to combat real dangers and for prevention work.
We demand a change in thinking: safety means taking social causes seriously, not putting people under general suspicion.
Only in this way can a solidary, just and truly safe urban society develop.
Safe school routes Children are the weakest participants in road traffic.
Injured or killed children belong to the sad chapter of our daily traffic.
Older children are particularly often injured on the way to school.
6- to 14-year-olds are particularly often injured on weekdays in the time from 7 to 8 am.
In this time, 14% of the injured children of the corresponding age were injured or killed in road traffic in 2024.
In the time from 15 to 16 o'clock they reach the second highest value with a share of 11% (Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany 2025).
This shows that particularly many children are injured in the times when they are on their way to school (OGS) or back.
In order to make school routes safer, the behavior of the children must also be taken into account, for example they often make mistakes when crossing the road.
Therefore we demand: • Parking bans in front of schools.
Crossing the road in the vicinity of schools must be possible without obstacles.
• Speed limits of 20 km/h in the area of schools and kindergartens.
• Increased school streets, which are closed to through traffic during rush hour (start and end of school).
• Clearly visible signs and, in case of poor visibility, illuminated crossings or zebra crossings in front of schools.
• Offering help services such as student crossing guards to prevent recklessness and cruising.
Dortmund has a serious problem with excessive speed and traffic-endangering driving.
Especially on weekends, on warm summer days and on busy roads such as the Wallring, recklessness is regularly observed.
This is not a trifle, but directly endangers the safety of road users and pedestrians.
We therefore demand the consistent installation and maintenance of permanently installed and modern speed measuring devices at critical points in the city.
Speeding violations must be recorded and punished without gaps.
Another aspect that affects the quality of life in many districts is so-called cruising, which is repeated, mostly This behavior in many cases violates § 30 of the Road Traffic Regulations (StVO), which prohibits unnecessary noise and exhaust emissions.
Nevertheless, the Ordnungsamt and the police have so far been insufficiently responsive to these disturbances of the peace, which particularly in the summer months significantly impair the night's rest.
We demand: • increased and visible control by the Ordnungsbehörden at known hotspots, • targeted measures to prevent cruising, for example through temporary no-go zones or technical traffic calming measures, • a clear condemnation of the public staging of motorized status behavior in the urban space.
In addition, we advocate for a city-wide, all-day speed limit of 30 km/h in the inner city area.
This measure has been proven to reduce the risk of accidents, as well as the risk of serious injury and death.
The noise level is significantly reduced and contributes to air purification and environmental protection.
Racial Profiling by the Police Racial Profiling exists, even if it is prohibited.
Many politicians overlook this issue and thus prevent an honest confrontation with institutional discrimination We are therefore advocating an independent scientific study to clarify whether and to what extent racial profiling is taking place in Dortmund police work.
We are calling on the city to initiate this study.
This serves as a sign of responsibility and as a basis for possible structural changes.
Only those who take discrimination seriously and are prepared to make it visible can ensure sustainable justice.
Dortmund can and should take on a pioneering role here: as a city that looks and acts instead of turning a blind eye.
It should actively promote diversity, fairness and social cohesion.
That is why we are calling for the following in addition to the independent study: • the establishment of a low-threshold, police-independent complaints office where those affected by discriminatory police checks can report incidents anonymously • regular and mandatory anti-discrimination and diversity training for the police, municipal law enforcement officers and administration • the systematic documentation and evaluation of police checks in order to make any possible patterns of discriminatory practice visible • a review of the police training programme in order to identify unintentional racial profiling, to remedy it and to prevent hasty use of firearms.
The decriminalisation of consumers and the regulation of the drug market is an effective step to achieve exactly that.
A sustainable drug policy relieves the police and judiciary.
Instead of persecuting people who need help and health support, investigative authorities can focus on the fight against serious, organised crime.
The causes of crime must be combated and its symptoms.
We want a city in which prevention, health care and social justice are at the forefront.
Political participation The voter turnout of only 47% in the last local elections in Dortmund is a poor reflection of the politics to date.
There is an urgent need for action to mobilise citizens to actively deal with the election in order to feel heard and understood.
Real problems of everyday life must be perceived and recognised by politicians.
Concepts must be developed and implemented that actively counteract political apathy.
There is a lack of campaigns that point to the election, there is a lack of motivation to participate in the election.
However, these are only symptoms of a long-term neglect of this issue.
There is a lack of citizen participation, a lack of communication channels between citizens and politicians.
We want a municipal youth council in Dortmund that represents the needs and wishes of the new generation and represents them in the city council.
Because a comprehensive policy can only work if it acts in the interests of future generations.
Maintaining the status quo is not a procedure that the youth of today simply accepts.
This is particularly clear with “Fridays for Future” and their offshoots.
Therefore, the city of Dortmund must take a stand on these issues!
Citizen dialogues and ethics committee We demand that citizen councils and citizen dialogues be founded from the citizenship for the problems of the future and the present, above all climate change, demographic change, globalization here in Dortmund and environmental protection.
In addition, we want to further strengthen the role of the recently founded and independent ethics committee, which takes a stand on social issues and advises the mayor and the city council.
Health burden Health is the highest good of every human being.
We want to anchor this guiding principle in local politics.
Dortmund, for example, is always doing very poorly, for example, when it comes to air quality and the increasing heat stress in the summer months.
Here we see a great need for action.
We must first significantly reduce cars in our city and let them disappear completely in the medium term, in order to further contain inner-city traffic and heat stress.
We are fighting for healthy school environments.
We are fighting for school kiosks and surrounding shops to be obliged to offer low-packaging organic food with fresh fruit and vegetables, which is still visually and tastefully attractive for children and young people.
Fast food should not be the only offer.
Reusable packaging or self-filling stations should be mandatory in order to avoid waste and promote healthy, sustainable nutrition.
We want to bring about closer cooperation between schools and the Dortmund Nutrition Council in this regard.
Local education policy We want Dortmund to make a strong commitment in local education policy.
Education policy is not just a matter for the federal government, but also for the cities.
The cities can have an influence on the educational success of the next generation.
This is already happening in early childhood education.
Good equipment for day care centers and kindergartens is just as essential as well-trained staff, whose value is appreciated through a pleasant working environment and appropriate pay.
Municipalities can also provide equipment and resources for schools, offer educational opportunities to students such as excursions, seminars, cooperations and insights into the work of the town hall.
Dortmund aims with its project “Kindercampus” to create a network of those involved in education, which brings together various educational and leisure facilities in the district, to unite them “under one roof” and to enable corresponding exchange.
The Children’s Commission has set itself the goal of implementing the quality standards of OGS despite the withdrawal of the state government from financing.
We demand that sufficient financial resources be made available at the municipal level in the long term.
Municipal cooperation with the local school landscape.
We want the concept of service learning to be introduced in Dortmund.
This is intended to strengthen the municipal awareness of young School gardens We are committed to ensuring that as many schools as possible, at least all primary schools, and perhaps even kindergartens, receive a garden area in which practical and sustainable skills are taught to the children and students.
This offers the opportunity to arouse the children's interest in flora and fauna and to impart a better understanding of their environment in a sustainable way.
In addition, children are already getting used to eating fruit and vegetables, because even if they are grown, it promotes their acceptance and thus makes an important contribution to a healthy diet.
They learn to take responsibility and experience how much work and effort it can mean.
Because even if it doesn't work, it belongs to it.
So the children become aware that it is not a matter of course to always have something to eat and appreciation is promoted, which can counteract food waste in the future.
Art and culture promotion Art and culture should not be a luxury.
That is why we are committed to ensuring that all cultural offerings are affordable and accessible to all citizens.
Politics can set the framework for social developments.
The positive possibilities that music, art and culture mean for people are scientifically proven Digital administration on an equal footing Digitalisation not just for the sake of digitalisation but with a real benefit for the citizens of our city.
Here we would like to see the following developments: • One-stop portal: all official procedures online, maximum three clicks.
• Service guarantee: binding response times; traffic light dashboard shows processing status.
• Collaboration between citizens and the administration: the administration and the city community simplify processes together.
They should be multilingual and transparent.
• Official communication in easy language by 2030.
What does the world look like that we are leaving to the next generation?
This is a question that more and more people are asking, and in many people the awareness of the destruction that we humans are causing is slowly awakening.
Environmental policy is future policy.
No matter how important every social reform and every social change may be, so it is said, everything will come to nothing if the world is facing an environmental crisis of unspoken proportions a few generations from now.
And yet, we reject all cynical pessimism and, at the same time, all illusory technocratic optimism.
Environmental protection is not simply dismissed with a CO2 premium, with action policies that do not change our reality.
Environmental protection means continued consistency, continued guidance.
We demand the strengthening of a conscious social lifestyle.
We demand a proper education about consumption, industry and consumption.
We want to give our fellow citizens the knowledge, the tools and the scope of action to decide on a sustainable lifestyle.
Sustainability may no longer be a question of the money bag, no question of external features.
We want and demand nothing less than that sustainability becomes a topic that influences the everyday decisions of our fellow citizens.
We want to make sustainability a process of thought that is considered self-evident.
For this reason, we promote an open and transparent discussion about the sustainability of our consumption, about the sustainability of our industry and our consumption of resources.
We promote a culture that competes for sustainability rather than profit margins!
Protecting the urban forest in the climate crisis The ecological forest concept approved by the council in 2023 is a great step forward for the protection of the 2,381 ha Dortmund city forest.
However, we are concerned about whether the forest will be able to withstand the increasing pressures in the face of rising temperatures.
Because in the ecological forest concept itself, it is noted on p.
5 that Dortmund has already warmed up by 1.5 degrees and that even with ambitious climate protection measures, a temperature increase of 3 to 3.8 degrees can be expected (IPCC scenario RCP 2.6).
Without further climate protection measures, the average temperature would rise to over 4 degrees, which would mean that the extreme years of 2014, 2018 and 2020 would become the new normal.
In view of this threat, we propose to follow the proposal of the Nature Conservation Association to develop and use half of the forest according to the developed concept and to take the other half completely out of use in order to observe which approach This is to be done according to the Lower Saxony model.
The aim is to preserve biodiversity, especially the native bird population, as well as to protect a diverse cultural landscape and the regional production of healthy food.
Civic engagement in the field of species protection is to be specifically promoted by municipal programs, for example, for the protection of meadow birds.
Climate neutrality by 2035 We consider it essential to adhere to the Paris Climate Agreement in order to stop unbridled heating, which would hit Dortmund hard in any case, as we have already exceeded the 1.5 degree limit in our city.
Unfortunately, in recent years there have been actors who want to shirk their responsibility, for example, the current US president.
This can create a bleak picture of our future, but we believe that we should fight all the more for adherence to the Paris Climate Agreement.
At the municipal level, Dortmund must show ambition to become a climate-neutral city by 2035.
In order to achieve this goal, a lot must change in the structures and the way we work together, or be decidedly continued.
We cannot afford to take a step backwards, such as the decision by DEW to buy new buses that run on fossil fuels, and we will not accept it.
Where new buildings are necessary, they should be built with a high proportion or even entirely with building materials from the recycling chain.
Paving should be avoided wherever possible.
Instead, we need more green spaces and many small forests in the city area to keep the heating within limits.
It is important that the forests flourish into a small healthy ecosystem and do not serve the monoculture for the economy.
The deconstruction of paved areas, even within the city, the renaturation of the rivers in the Dortmund city area, as has already been successful with the Emscher, as well as a consumption behavior that is oriented towards sustainability.
From the plastic chair made of bioplastics to green facades to the prioritization of building preservation and new buildings made of 100% recycled materials, all of this belongs to a change towards climate neutrality.
Of course, the city itself should also pay attention to an environmentally and socially sustainable administration, such as using renewable We support the already positive approaches that exist in Dortmund.
Green hydrogen as a storage medium We fundamentally welcome the establishment of a hydrogen economy in our city, provided that it is exclusively produced from sustainable energy.
Hydrogen can play an important role in a decentralised, climate-friendly energy supply, but only if it is produced entirely from renewable energy, i.e.
as green hydrogen.
Only this makes a genuine contribution to climate protection.
However, what we are seeing is a different picture: Dortmunder Stadtwerke (DSW21) and its subsidiary DEW21 are presenting themselves publicly as pioneers of sustainable hydrogen use, but at the same time they are planning to use hydrogen as a regular energy source for transport and heating, contrary to the recommendations of science and the climate goals.
We see this as an attempt to continue to operate fossil gas infrastructure under the guise of sustainability.
Even if the existing gas network can be technically converted to hydrogen, this still does not mean that sufficient quantities of green hydrogen are available, let alone at reasonable ecological and social conditions.
Imported hydrogen brings new dependencies • Its use in transport or for building heating is inefficient, expensive and blocks real progress in the energy transition.
• We reject the use of blue (from natural gas) or grey (from coal) hydrogen, as well as the greenwashing that tries to sell it as “climate-neutral”.
Instead, we are focusing on: • Decentralised electrification throughout the city, particularly through heat pumps, solar thermal energy, wind power and geothermal energy.
• Affordable local green electricity for all Dortmund residents.
• Limiting combined heat and power with industrial waste heat to a clearly defined transitional phase.
In our opinion, the current strategy of DSW21 and DEW21 endangers Dortmund’s climate goals and thus the future viability of our city.
We will continue to publicly name this shortcoming and make a strong commitment to a real, affordable and socially just energy transition locally.
Full re-municipalisation of Dortmund’s municipal utilities Since 2009, Dortmund residents have been calling for the re-municipalisation of the city’s energy supply, an issue that has been prevented to this We consider it a disgrace that 39.9 percent of DSW21 subsidiary DEW21 (Dortmunder Energie und Wasser 21) is still owned by EON, which in turn is connected to RWE through its investment policy.
We are calling for the city of Dortmund to buy back these EON facilities and convert the municipal utilities into businesses that operate in the common good.
This means that these businesses will include the balancing of the common good.
The RWE corporation consistently ignores the need to prioritize the protection of climate and biodiversity over profit interests, as we have had to painfully observe for decades in the Rheinische Tagebau.
We are relying on the following methods: • improved communication and disclosure of the strategy of the municipal utilities to the citizens • financial participation by citizens through the use of innovative financing instruments (for example Climate savings bonds, establishment of citizen-owned solar and wind energy facilities, citizen funds and the involvement of citizen cooperatives in the ownership structure) • integration into Local Agenda 21 • improvement of the municipal political influence in supervisory comm The evaluations of train stations in Dortmund regularly occupy the top places in the ranking of the worst train stations.
The city must urgently exert influence on transport partners such as the railway and VRR.
Our commitment to the expansion and free provision of public transport not only offers social and infrastructural advantages.
It also helps to significantly improve Dortmund's air quality.
The tightened EU limit values for air pollutants from 2030 pose enormous challenges for cities like Dortmund and our city is lagging behind with key measures: the expansion of public transport is taking too long and the frequency is insufficient.
Public transport must be given absolute priority over private car-based road traffic.
We expect closer cooperation between the responsible parties and the Dortmund Environmental Office.
Economic interests, political decisions or other city departments are slowing down the Environmental Office and thus necessary measures.
Therefore, our plan is: • Accelerated expansion of barrier-free access at all stops and train stations.
• The planned innovation line 400 is to improve bus traffic in the city center from October.
We want a more frequent timetable on all days of the week and also at the weekend.
• The Stadtbahn network must plan new routes and be better connected with the bus network.
• The often too long waiting times in the outskirts and too poorly frequented lines must be improved by the use of smaller and more flexible vehicles.
• The conversion to emission-free vehicles such as e-buses must take place significantly faster.
• The payment of employees in public transport must be fair and according to the public service tariff.
We reject wage dumping via subsidiaries.
• Tickets are often too expensive and unfair, because deficits such as Dortmund Airport are also co-financed.
That is why we are campaigning for a gradual tariff reform: • First a simplified and transparent tariff structure.
• Then an affordable 1-euro annual ticket (365-euro ticket).
• In the long term, free public transport for all.
• The city must use its opportunities to influence so that train stations and especially S-Bahn stations in Dortmund finally become modernised, barrier-free and safe.
• In addition, we support the expansion of the H-Bahn as an ecologically and technically positive offer.
The H-Bahn is innovative due to its automated operation and is largely emission-free on the road.
However, economically, it must be carefully examined how expansion can take place in order to ensure a significantly increasing use and thus make its contribution to the transportation revolution in the best possible way.
Dortmund must implement the transportation revolution with more speed, more investments and social justice.
Only in this way can the city meet the tightened EU air quality requirements, avoid driving bans and fines and improve the quality of life for all.
A strong, barrier-free and affordable public transport system is the key to sustainable and future-oriented mobility.
Transportation revolution: open to innovations In addition to the ideas already described, we are open to the topic of transportation revolution towards a climate-neutral city with new concepts and ideas, which could include: • Car-free neighborhoods • Superblocks: residential blocks in which through traffic is prohibited.
Only residents are allowed to enter at a walking pace; the freed-up road space is landscaped and We want more safety for cyclists on the roads in Dortmund, our own cycle lanes, a separation of road and cycle paths, expansion of cycle paths, a cycle premium and cycle boxes at every stop.
Dortmund has the potential to become a real cycling city, but plans such as the 2019 council resolution on the "cycling city of Dortmund" are slow and incomplete.
The Ruhr Cycle Superhighway (RS1) has been in the planning stages for years, but implementation in Dortmund is barely progressing.
Completion was supposed to take place as early as 2024, but there are further delays, which we criticize.
Many dedicated professionals in the city administration want to promote cycling, but they often struggle against too tight budgets, a lack of support and complicated decision-making processes.
That is why we demand: • enough staff positions be created, • sufficient funds be made available, • and the experts be given more responsibility and decision-making power.
• Cyclists should be given priority in all planning and construction measures.
• A new, safe cycle path is more important than even more car parking spaces.
Public space should be distributed fairly!
• The • Every new cycle path must meet modern standards: wide, safe, well-maintained, even at construction sites and intersections.
• In addition to infrastructure, a new awareness is needed.
We support campaigns, promote good bicycle parking facilities and strengthen local initiatives.
Nordspange – construction madness We as the animal welfare party reject the planned construction of the Hoeschallee as part of the so-called Nordspange decisively.
This road construction project is backward-looking in terms of climate policy, superfluous in terms of transport, economically irresponsible and socially and ecologically damaging.
The city of Dortmund plans to finance the 62 million euro road solely from municipal funds and without subsidies from the state.
This is not only economic madness, but also blocks much-needed investments in education, social housing, public transport and municipal infrastructure.
We oppose a policy that still relies on new motorways, even though the city has committed to climate neutrality by 2035 and to a transport revolution.
The construction of the Hoeschallee fundamentally contradicts both goals: it promotes additional car Especially socially disadvantaged districts like Nordstadt need less traffic, better air and safe ways for children, cyclists and pedestrians.
Therefore we demand: 1.
Immediate stop of the planning and further construction of the Hoeschallee/Nordspange.
2.
Use of the funds for a social and ecological transportation revolution, especially for public transport expansion, safe bike paths, safe routes to school and barrier-free footpaths.
3.
Renunciation of new road construction projects in Dortmund that contradict the goal of climate neutrality.
4.
Binding prioritization of rail transport and public transport in all future urban mobility plans.
5.
A moratorium on all planned large-scale projects that are not in line with climate goals, species protection and environmental protection.
We are fighting for a city in which people and animals are protected from noise, exhaust fumes and sealing of land.
Demolition of Dortmund Airport Dortmund is trying to reduce emissions in the city in cooperation with its citizens and to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030.
This is undermined by the fact that the city simply ignores the high emission values of the airport when calculating climate-damaging emissions.
But that's not all.
Instead of reducing emissions, Dortmund Airport is pursuing a completely irresponsible growth strategy in terms of climate policy and is announcing the increase in flights and flight movements as a success.
However, only a few benefit from this.
The truth is that the airport represents an unbearable environmental burden with its high CO2 emissions and the massive noise and exhaust gas pollution it causes for Dortmund citizens.
The Dortmund Airport is a subsidized prestige object.
Dortmund citizens have to endure the noise and exhaust fumes and unknowingly finance it with their public transport tickets Since our region has a well-developed airport in Düsseldorf with good public transport connections, there is no justification for the continued existence of Dortmund airport.
Dortmund airport is a disastrous environmental polluter that is easily avoidable.
The recent expansion of the airport to a low-cost airline airport does not make things any better.
Therefore, we want to ban private jets from taking off and landing, stop advertising flights, cancel frequent flyer bonus systems and instead introduce a progressive frequent flyer tax.
We also want to systematically reduce the number of flights over Dortmund, dismantle the airport and, in the medium term, close it in a socially acceptable way.
This should be done in stages to offer new job prospects to employees, so that as few jobs as possible are lost.
The freed-up areas should be integrated into urban life, for example for residential areas or a large park.
The use of environmentally friendly energy can be tested in the meantime to mitigate damage.
Plant Based Treaty Currently, there is a climate, marine and biodiversity crisis.
Fossil fuels and animal husbandry are the driving forces behind the runaway We also need to take action in relation to the food system.
And this is where the Plant Based Treaty comes in.
The three main greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane and laughing gas have reached record levels and their increase is rapidly increasing.
Animal husbandry contributes to all three greenhouse gases, but is the main cause of methane and laughing gas emissions worldwide.
Through individual and systemic changes, communities, companies and governments can work together at all levels and at every point of intervention.
The switch to a vegan diet has the greatest positive impact that a person can take on the planet.
The IPCC agrees that a switch to plant-based nutrition can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food.
A study by the University of Oxford has calculated that major changes in the food system would be necessary, i.e.
that every person worldwide would have to switch to a plant-based diet in order to reduce food emissions by up to 70%.
We will work to ensure that the city of Dortmund becomes part of the Plant Based Treaty initiative.
Nutrition in public facilities In addition to our demands for vegan alternatives in public facilities, we want all public and private facilities here in Dortmund to focus on regional and seasonal nutrition.
Foods with a poor emission value must disappear from Dortmund's canteens, also in order to get closer to the goal of a climate-neutral city.
In addition, the canteens of public facilities must be role models that other companies would like to emulate.
Organic farming It is essential to systematically and consistently increase the consumption of organically produced goods and food.
The canteens of municipal companies, such as FABIDO, as well as the Dortmund initiatives of solidarity farming, are already making good progress in this regard.
In the further implementation of this path, we consider the Dortmund Nutrition Council and the Dortmund Regional Group of the Gemeinwohlökonomie to be important partners who help companies that decide to switch to organic farming to market their products locally.
Emission value information / labelling obligation in the catering industry In order to achieve the goal of a climate-neutral city, we consider it necessary to also include the local c This will provide better transparency for ingredients from breeding or production methods that perhaps not everyone wants to support.
In addition, a binding and transparent labeling of vegan and vegetarian dishes must be implemented.
We are calling for an end to the half-hearted labeling of allergens.
It is a great shame for our society that people with allergies are still exposed to great health risks today when they want to eat out.
The current labeling obligation is often generously ignored, the staff is clueless, the lists are not visible.
Many allergens are not even mentioned.
This thoughtlessness leads to people with allergies feeling excluded from parts of social life.
We consider this to be discrimination, which we vehemently reject.
That is why we are calling for a reform of the labelling obligation.
In order to achieve the goal of a climate-neutral city, we believe it is necessary to also include local catering establishments in the emission value statements.
That is why we want to see local catering establishments awarded a label by an independent inspection body that indicates the emission values emitted in a traffic light system.
We demand: • All ingredients of the dishes must be stated, because almost every ingredient can contain an allergen.
• The corresponding lists must be openly displayed, depending on the size of the restaurant, also in multiple copies • they should also be digitally accessible, such as QR codes next to the dishes or on the menu, which lead to a corresponding website listing the ingredients, in order to save paper and resources.
In order to achieve the goal of a climate-neutral city, we believe it is necessary to also include local catering establishments in emission value statements.
That is why we want to see local catering establishments awarded a label by an independent inspection body that indicates the emission values emitted in a traffic light system.
Food waste Far too many foods are thrown Even here in Dortmund, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.
throw away food that is still edible.
That is why we want the city of Dortmund to fight for a close-knit network within Dortmund, between businesses that have to give away food and people or organizations that would take this food.
For this purpose, the legal framework should be created at the municipal level.
More greenery and less sealing When we talk about greenery, we often only mean green areas on the ground.
However, our city offers so many opportunities in height!
We want Dortmund to become greener vertically as well.
For this purpose, we demand an adjustment of the building code, which makes the greening of facades, flat roofs and bus stops mandatory.
This not only improves the air, but also creates new habitats.
Where necessary, this should be financially supported.
Green urban buildings are a must for a modern, future-proof city!
A city like Dortmund must not only slow down climate change, but also adapt to its consequences.
Green roofs and facades act like natural air conditioning and air filters.
Intensive roof greening even provides space for gardens, leisure and relaxation.
In Dortmund there are countless schools and public buildings that would be ideal for this.
Such greening can best be implemented during planned renovations and conversions in order to keep costs and effort low.
We also demand free drinking water dispensers for humans and animals in public places.
In Dortmund, water channels run under the asphalt in the city.
These could be opened up and made accessible to improve the city's climate.
As part of these measures, nesting aids for insects and wild bees should be mounted on buildings as a matter of principle.
At the same time, we want to better inform garden owners about suitable nesting aids, as many solutions offered in the market are unfortunately unsuitable for our native insects.
Bees are indispensable for our nature.
80% of our cultivated and wild plants depend on their pollination.
While honey bees receive a lot of attention, around 300 of the 560 native wild bee species are threatened with extinction.
The loss of their habitat due to the sealing of surfaces and the disappearance of diverse food plants promotes their extinction.
Since wild bees do not fly long distances, flowering strips must be created throughout the city.
We demand that Dortmund creates flowering strips on all green spaces and currently unused fallow land.
The selection of plants must not be based on appearance, but exclusively on their value for the bees, with a large variety of native, regional species.
More and more front gardens are being transformed into low-maintenance stone deserts.
However, these small green spaces are enormously important for species diversity and the city climate.
They are habitats for plants, insects and birds and provide fresh, clean air.
In contrast, stone gardens heat up extremely and intensify the heat in the city.
This becomes a problem, especially when important fresh air corridors are lost due to new construction.
Therefore, we demand that stone gardens should be fundamentally prohibited in new construction.
We want to inform owners of existing stone gardens about the disadvantages and offer them a premium for a natural replanting.
We demand a consistent change of mindset in the use of land.
Sealed urban areas should be identified and, where possible, quickly de-sealed and ecologically upgraded.
We can learn a lot from our neighbors: In the Netherlands, for example, there are actions like "Tegelwippen" (Fliesenkippen), how citizens actively de-seal and green their cities.
We want to promote this commitment in Dortmund as well.
For example, former parking lots can be converted into green recreational areas or movement areas such as basketball courts.
The implementation can be done together with the citizens, of course with professional support and rewarded by the municipal currency “Dortmunder Kohle” that we have already proposed.
In this way we can win back quality of life, improve our climate and at the same time strengthen the civic commitment for a greener Dortmund.
If a voluntary sealing is not carried out, we must consider whether the city should oblige property owners to seal their property.
We support the establishment of a municipal sealing fund (70% subsidy for sealing private areas) and a city-wide stone garden ban.
Parking spaces in the city center should be turned into pocket parks with slightly larger areas than tiny forests.
Threatened plant species.
We are committed to systematically recording declining native plant species in Dortmund and developing protective measures.
Through targeted settlement projects, for example in urban green spaces, schoolyards or community gardens, we want to create habitats that benefit both biodiversity and people.
Such win-win projects combine nature conservation with education, leisure and urban green spaces for all.
Glyphosate and nitrate pollution.
We welcome the development of Dortmund as The massive reduction of all environmentally harmful so-called plant protection agents in urban areas as well as on leased land is therefore a priority for us.
Together with environmental associations and farmers, solutions must be found here as quickly as possible.
We expect the city to consistently implement the council resolution from November 2023, according to which the lease agreements are extended to 8 years and the farmers in return implement a simple nature conservation measure on their fields.
This will be an important step for sustainable agriculture and planning security for farming operations in Dortmund.
The use of glyphosate and other environmentally harmful substances is to be banned throughout the city on the basis of the council resolution in order to protect birds and insects as well as small animals and no longer unnecessarily burden the surrounding waters.
Not only plants and animals suffer from the consequences of this poisoning, they get into the groundwater, are found again in drinking water and ultimately also accumulate in the human organism.
The massive fertilization with manure is also to be restricted, because the high nitrate load of the drinking water has long since reached an unacceptable health risk.
The drinking water Despite the current harmlessness, nitrate pollution is a sensitive issue, as it is mainly caused by intensive agriculture, especially excessive fertilization and manure production.
In the long term, this can lead to an increased nitrate concentration in groundwater, which in turn could impair the quality of drinking water.
The Federal Administrative Court recently ruled that North Rhine-Westphalia must improve its programs to reduce nitrate pollution in groundwater.
This underlines the need for proactive measures at the municipal level.
Therefore, we demand: • Transparency and information: Regular publication of current nitrate values in drinking water by the city of Dortmund to comprehensively inform citizens.
• Preventive measures: Promotion of environmentally friendly agricultural practices, such as the use of organic fertilizers and the establishment of buffer zones to water bodies, to minimize the entry of nitrate into groundwater.
• Initiation of programs in cooperation with agriculture to establish sustainable management methods and reduce nitrate pollution in the long term.
Through these measures, Dortmund can not only ensure the quality of its drinking water, but also make a contribution to protecting the environment The so-called forever chemicals (PFAS) also pose a serious threat.
We demand that the pollution of waters in the Dortmund city area be checked and that an appropriate analysis and measures for their protection be taken.
Light pollution Dortmund, like almost every larger city, has a problem with light pollution.
For a long time, it was a niche issue, but today the subject of light is given much more attention than was previously the case.
The negative influence of excessive night-time lighting on humans, animals and vegetation is well researched today.
However, Dortmund has not yet presented a concept.
We therefore demand the conception of a gradual reduction of light pollution.
With its implementation, a scientific study is to take place, which examines the impact of the measures on local insect populations, in order to promote scientific exchange with other cities and to serve as a role model.
Under the increasing light pollution, more and more insects are suffering, including pollinators, which either lose their orientation or have to die a painful death due to artificial light.
Although bees are not nocturnal, light pollution causes a decrease of 62% in their pollination performance.
Therefore, it is strongly recommended that when selecting any street lamp and any lighting solution for a public or municipal building, these should be chosen according to the principles of the lowest possible light pollution.
In addition to the great benefits for the environment, the targeted use of lighting technology also makes it possible to save energy and, therefore, costs.
With the conversion of all 54,000 street lamps by 2027, Dortmund has taken an important first step.
In the course of the "Smart City" project, our city saves half of the previous energy costs through the use of controllable and dimmable LED lighting.
Nevertheless, we still have a problem with light pollution.
The commendable citizen science project "Nachtlicht BÜHNE" should be further promoted and presented more intensively to the people.
This is intended to encourage Dortmund citizens to participate.
Litter pollution The amount of litter on Dortmund's streets is unacceptable and must be urgently reduced.
We are committed to sustainable cleanliness in our city.
Our strategy is based on several pillars: • Increased awareness-raising: The city should intensify its cooperation with local associations and non-profit initiatives in order to raise awareness of cleanliness and environmental protection among the population.
• More consistent action against environmental offences: People who repeatedly dispose of their rubbish thoughtlessly in public areas should not be given the impression that their behaviour is tolerated.
High fines are appropriate here, especially for cigarette butts and other small items.
• Improved infrastructure: As a first step, we demand the widespread installation of sufficient public litter bins and containers, especially in heavily frequented green spaces and public places.
• Clear communication and enforcement: Following the improvement of disposal options, a municipal campaign should draw attention to a changed approach by the Ordnance Office.
• Clearly marked bulky waste zones should minimise illegal dumps.
It must be possible to apply for bulky waste in a low-threshold manner.
Multilingual notices with instructions in rental properties should be mandatory for landlords and housing administrations.
We want to send a clear signal: rubbish on the street is By using the resources available in our cities, we can make an important contribution to protecting the environment and conserving scarce resources.
We are committed to the systematic extraction of raw materials from existing buildings, infrastructure and landfills.
This form of raw material extraction enables a regional circular economy and conserves natural resources, as building materials are reused and transport from distant primary sources is avoided.
The city of Dortmund should integrate urban mining into its construction and waste strategy, strengthen local recycling chains and make ecological, social and economic benefits for the region usable, as successful examples from cities like Zurich have already shown.
Animal welfare Animal welfare policy currently plays too little of a role in our city.
We stand, among other things, for greater financial support for animal welfare associations, the Dortmund animal welfare centre and for a city pigeon concept based on the Augsburg model, excluding a feeding ban.
The dog tax should be used for what it is collected for and should be abolished for dogs adopted from animal welfare.
We want environmentally friendly material in dog poop bags, free dispensers throughout the city, more litter b In the short term, we are striving for a stronger commitment to the most animal-friendly possible keeping.
We support the demand that, at long last, effective fire protection measures be taken for stables in the city area.
It is unacceptable that thousands of living beings should die a cruel death every year because necessary protective devices are missing and maintenance is only carried out inadequately for cost reasons!
For reasons of animal and environmental protection, we should refrain from using fireworks on New Year's Eve, and instead allow, for example, threatening shows.
Fact-based education about animal keeping We want Dortmund to be a city in which people and animals feel comfortable.
We demand that animals in Dortmund are not subjected to unnecessary suffering.
We think that much of this is due to ignorance and thoughtlessness.
That is why we want to work towards establishing contact points in Dortmund that inform citizens about animal-friendly keeping and organize seminars.
Combating animal cruelty Unfortunately, animal cruelty is still often a minor offence.
We want this criminal behavior to be punished more severely, or rather.
This is something that is not being pursued at all.
Because all too often, the authorities are far too lax in their response to such cases.
We want to ensure that such behaviour is no longer tolerated, that we as a society take a firm stand against animal cruelty and no longer turn a blind eye to it.
The departments of public order and veterinary services must be adequately staffed to do this, to carry out more checks and follow up on tips from the public, and to impose bans on keeping animals at home and on so-called farm animals, if necessary.
Strengthening the Dortmund Animal Welfare Centre We want to see the staff at the Dortmund Animal Welfare Centre expanded and better connected with animal welfare NGOs.
The Animal Welfare Centre should represent animal welfare and be the first port of call for people who want to help.
If the current location is not big enough for this, then relocation or the creation of branch offices should be made possible.
Support for animal welfare associations and initiatives A large proportion of animal welfare work in Dortmund is carried out by associations, initiatives and committed individuals.
Without these people and their diverse range of Only last year, our party's proposal led to volunteers from three Dortmund animal welfare associations being awarded by the city of Dortmund for their commitment.
However, we demand support beyond recognition and applause, whether through financial means or support in the acquisition of necessary work equipment, medical equipment or veterinary costs.
City pigeon management Pigeons are intelligent and social animals that are wrongly referred to as "rats of the sky".
It is scientifically proven that pigeons do not pose a health risk.
It is therefore certain that damage to building substance is not caused by pigeon droppings, but by air pollutants.
We demand the abolition of feeding bans and instead advocate for the feeding of pigeons in a species-appropriate manner.
Pigeons are grain eaters and resort to waste as a last resort, which leads to serious illnesses in the animals, including the so-called "hunger droppings".
We also advocate for the prohibition of pigeon deterrent measures such as spikes and nets.
For population regulation, we advocate the construction of pigeon lofts or pigeon houses In many cities, the sometimes large number of pigeons is lamented.
However, it is overlooked that pigeon racing has contributed significantly to the problem and continues to do so, because many city pigeons are released pigeons or those that can no longer find their way home.
We therefore advocate the abolition of pigeon racing in order to prevent the permanent reproduction.
Against this background, we demand: 1.
Creation of further pigeon houses throughout the city.
In addition to several locations in the city center, each district of the city should get a pigeon house.
2.
Containers instead of towers.
Instead of complex tower constructions, proven solutions from other cities, such as converted containers, should be used.
3.
For the operation, local clubs and groups are to be won over and financially supported.
4.
The focus of the work is to be on schools and day care centers, in order to educate the population about prejudices against pigeons.
No wedding doves - and butterfly releases We demand an explicit ban on the release of animals for entertainment or decoration purposes at public or private events, especially the so-called release of wedding doves and the staging of butterfly releases, for example at weddings or celebrations.
What is marketed as romantic or symbolic actually means stress, suffering and often death for the affected animals.
Animals are not props.
Real romance does not require animal suffering.
Why we are calling for a ban: • Wedding doves are not wild animals.
The white pigeons used for this are mostly domesticated homing pigeons, which are dependent on a life in the pigeon loft.
Many of them do not find their way back, get lost, starve or die in accidents or as a result of predators.
The idea of a “home flight” is an illusion.
• Butterfly flights are animal cruelty: butterflies, mostly bred and transported in small containers, are released into the air at events, often weakened, disoriented or unable to fly because they are kept so cold that they are immobile.
Many die within a short time as a result of exhaustion, cold or lack of food.
For a short show moment, they are left to a cruel fate.
• There is basically no animal-friendly or sustainable animal use.
Neither pigeons nor insects may be misused for human insinuations.
Such actions contradict basic animal welfare and ethical handling of sentient beings.
• Providers of such services conceal the suffering behind the “symbolic release” and deceive customers with claims about return flight training or animal-friendly living conditions.
The reality is different.
That is why we demand: 1.
Municipal ban on the release of animals for entertainment purposes.
Dortmund should fundamentally prohibit the release of wedding doves, butterflies or other animals for decorative or symbolic purposes by means of a municipal ordinance.
2.
Violations of the ban should be consistently punished with fines, both against service providers and against private individuals who release corresponding animals or organize events of this kind.
3.
The city should actively inform about the hidden animal suffering behind such actions, for example in the registry office, at wedding fairs and at event agencies.
Alternative, animal-friendly rituals should be specifically promoted.
Pigeons and fancy pigeons: breeding and exhibitions should be stopped.
We are committed to an animal-friendly and future-oriented Dortmund.
The so-called pigeon sport is associated with massive animal suffering and contradicts an ethical approach to sentient beings.
Our goal is to abolish this practice in the long term.
Our demands: 1.
The targeted breeding and use of pigeons for competitions leads to countless losses and deaths every year due to exhaustion, disorientation, extreme weather or lack of return.
We strongly reject this form of animal use and it must be abolished in the long term.
2.
Fancy pigeon breeding focuses on external characteristics and often leads to cruel breeding (for example Overly large crops or head shapes, restricted vision or flight ability).
Exhibitions of this kind promote these breeding goals and should not be allowed to take place in Dortmund.
3.
We demand that the city run information campaigns about the reality of pigeon racing, about selective breeding and the consequences of abandoned wedding pigeons.
Only through education and enlightenment can decisions that are friendly to animals be promoted in the long term.
Education can be provided to children in primary school.
Animal emergency aid for our city Animals are always in acute distress.
Due to accidents, illnesses, neglect or extreme weather conditions.
We therefore demand a municipal emergency aid system for animals that immediately takes effect in crisis situations and is permanently supported by the city.
Animals need fast, competent and supportive help in emergencies, just like people.
The city of Dortmund cannot shirk this responsibility.
Our ideas for this are: 1.
We demand the establishment of an emergency fund within the framework of the existing animal welfare fund, from which our animal welfare associations and the animal welfare center Dortmund can be provided with financial resources for the treatment of injured or neglected animals quickly and without bureaucracy, for example For stray animals or animals from animal hoarding cases.
2.
The treatment of injured or sick stray animals and wild animals must be free of charge in Dortmund in principle.
The financing must be secured by municipal funds.
Only in this way can it be ensured that citizens can help in emergencies without financial hurdles.
The barrier to bringing an injured animal to a veterinary clinic or practice must no longer be created by possible treatment costs.
Everyone should be able to help.
Often, finders have to pay the costs out of their own pocket if they offer to take care of the found animal themselves.
The municipal funds are essential for this.
3.
The city of Dortmund should make firm cooperation agreements with animal welfare organizations and associations in order to be able to act in a coordinated and quick manner in emergencies, including access to municipal logistics, accommodation or medical care.
4.
We demand a city-coordinated emergency hotline for animal emergencies, which is available around the clock, as well as clearly regulated responsibilities within the administration (veterinary office, order office), in order to ensure quick reactions.
5.
The city should also provide information to prevent animal emergencies.
For example, on heat protection, care of older animals, first aid for pets or legal obligations when keeping animals.
Tax and leash regulations for dogs We want the dog tax to be converted into a purpose-bound dog owner fee.
The revenue from this should be earmarked for the animal welfare center and for animal welfare projects and associations in Dortmund.
The leash requirement should be relaxed for old, sick and disabled dogs, as there are always unfair fines for owners because the animal is no longer able to walk on a leash.
Expansion of the animal welfare representative position We demand the targeted expansion of the position of independent animal welfare representatives in the city.
Currently, the city of Dortmund has a voluntary animal welfare representative.
This is a step in the right direction.
However, in view of the increasing burden on the responsible departments, especially in the veterinary and law enforcement areas, it is necessary to strengthen and expand the structures.
Therefore, we demand: 1.
Instead of a single animal welfare representative, several positions should be created in the future to ensure comprehensive and effective monitoring and advice.
The tasks range from the control of animal welfare-relevant processes to expert assessments and advice to citizens and authorities.
2.
Only people with proven qualifications in animal protection are considered for this task.
These include: • Active animal rights activists with documented commitment in recognized organizations • People with training or a degree in veterinary medicine, biology, animal protection law, etc.
• No persons from hunting clubs or interest groups that are in conflict with animal protection principles 3.
The animal protection officers should act independently of economic or hunting interests.
Their decisions must be based solely on the animal protection law, the ethics of life protection and scientific knowledge.
4.
Volunteer animal protection officers make an important social contribution.
Therefore, they should receive an appropriate compensation for their work in order to secure and honor their commitment, even if the positions are not full-time.
5.
In addition to volunteer or compensated forces, we demand the introduction of a permanent, full-time position for an animal protection officer in Dortmund.
This person should be permanently integrated into the administrative structure, with clear responsibilities, rights of participation and an interface function between administration, politics and the population.
6.
The animal welfare officers should act as a link between citizens, the city administration and animal welfare organizations.
Their voice should be heard in relevant municipal committees.
Threatened animal species and protection of habitats We are committed to the recording and targeted protection of threatened animal species in Dortmund.
Habitats should be restored or renatured, for example through natural green spaces, flower strips, nesting opportunities or water renaturation.
The aim is an ecological upgrade that not only serves the protection of species, but also enriches the cityscape and allows people to experience nature more in their everyday lives.
Newly created habitats such as the Wickeder Waldsee must be preserved at all costs.
Invasive species Invasive species such as Nile and Canadian geese, nutria and raccoons are an increasing challenge for biodiversity.
Invasive species can displace native species, disrupt sensitive ecosystems and cause economic damage.
But invasive species also have a right to life and their control should not be limited to cruel or lethal methods such as hunting and trapping.
We advocate for an ethical approach to all animals and call for innovative, non-violent approaches that reconcile the protection of biodiversity with animal welfare values.
We want to actively promote the research and development of animal-friendly methods of population control, including immunological contraception and genetically assisted fertility control.
At the same time, we call for more support for scientific projects that investigate the impact of invasive species on ecosystems and develop sustainable solutions.
To prevent the entry of invasive species, we want to expand preventive measures.
Early warning systems should be set up in sensitive regions to detect invasive species in good time.
We also call for stricter control of trade routes and effective quarantine measures to prevent the introduction of invasive species.
We also call for greater support for natural regulation and habitat management.
By improving the habitats of native species, we can strengthen their resistance to invasive species.
Where it is ecologically justifiable, we want to promote natural predators of invasive species in order to regulate their populations without human intervention.
Education and awareness-raising are central components of our approach.
We want to inform the public about invasive species, their impact and animal-friendly alternatives to hunting.
At the same time, we demand training for professionals in order to apply non-violent measures effectively and professionally.
We also advocate for close international cooperation.
In border regions, cross-border control is essential.
We want to promote the exchange of knowledge and best practices in order to develop effective and animal-friendly solutions together.
Our goal is to protect biodiversity and to preserve the life and dignity of every animal.
Hunting can no longer be considered the standard solution for controlling invasive species.
Instead, we demand a modern change towards ethical, sustainable and scientifically-based approaches that are in line with our values.
We demand a ban on wild animals in circuses.
In the federal states where there is no wild animal ban in circuses, the municipalities must take action through a corresponding council resolution.
Unfortunately, NRW has not yet issued a statewide wild animal ban in circuses.
We are fighting for the protection of animals and a nationwide implementation of performance bans for circuses with wild animals.
The aim of a municipal wild animal ban is to prevent inhumane and cruel treatment and “training” of animals in circuses.
If more and more EU countries and cities, now over 120, decide on a performance ban for circuses that bring wild animals with them or show them in their “show”, the keeping of wild animals and wild animal dressage will become unattractive for the circuses.
This will further reduce the inhumane keeping and “training” along the guidelines of the performance possibilities and the market.
Our goal is to generally have no animal shows in circuses.
This serves to protect the animals as fellow creatures.
The use of animals as entertainment no longer corresponds to the current view of animals as living beings, not things.
In particular, the living conditions of wild animals in captivity in travelling circuses are cramped, they are subjected to forced training, noise and bright lights in the arena, and this is a torture for them.
The use of wild animals in captivity to perform unnatural tricks under duress for the entertainment of children is also questionable from a pedagogical point of view.
Many renowned circuses have now voluntarily given up keeping animals.
The “Jagd & Hund” (hunting and dog) fair and cage hunting.
The “Jagd & Hund” fair, which takes place annually in Dortmund, is one of the largest hunting fairs in Europe and serves as a platform for the marketing of hunting trips and hunting equipment.
Here, trophy hunts in Africa or Eastern Europe are advertised, and the killing of wild animals is glorified as a leisure activity.
The city of Dortmund should no longer be available as a venue for an event that promotes hunting as a sport and hobby.
We therefore call on All practices do not serve the protection of species or the sustainable use of natural resources, but are an expression of a cruel leisure activity that kills animals for pure pleasure and profit.
Especially hunting trips and cage hunting are an expression of an antiquated, animal-hostile thinking that only serves the profit and leisure interests of individuals.
We as the Animal Welfare Party strictly reject these practices and are committed to a fundamental reform of hunting law.
Hunting trips are organized trips to countries where wealthy hunters can kill wild animals.
Protected animal species are often killed in a cruel way.
Hunting trips to Africa, Eastern Europe and North America are particularly popular, where lions, elephants, bears or deer are killed for high sums.
Despite the argument that this hunting serves the protection of species, numerous studies show that trophy hunting often has the opposite effect.
It contributes to the decline of endangered species, undermines protective measures and leads to animal cruelty.
In addition, local communities are rarely fairly involved in the proceeds.
The freshly killed animals are often displayed in inappropriate positions.
We want to see the banning of pheasant shoots, where animals are bred in enclosed areas and then sold to paying hunters to be shot.
The animals have very limited opportunities to escape, so in many cases they end up in panic and have little chance to protect themselves from the hunters.
This form of hunting is particularly cruel and has nothing to do with “sporting hunting” and only serves the economic interests of those who run it.
We are campaigning for Germany to actively oppose the import of hunting trophies.
In the long term, we are striving for an end to (hobby) hunting in Germany.
Natural ecosystems do not require human regulation through shooting, but rather sensible wildlife management based on scientific findings.
Closure of the Schliefenanlage in Dortmund.
In Dortmund there is a hidden Schliefenanlage belonging to the German Teckelklub, in which live foxes are kept and tortured for the training of hunting dogs under extremely stressful conditions.
These facilities consist of artificial tunnel systems that are modelled on fox dens.
The foxes remain there in lifelong captivity and under constant threat from Nevertheless, sleeping facilities are not sufficiently controlled or banned by law, as the keeping is usually not classified as commercial and the facilities are not subject to any effective official supervision.
There are also such legal and practical deficits in Dortmund, although the veterinary office knows the facility and since 2022 there have been offers to take the foxes into humane care.
We therefore demand: 1.
Immediate closure of all sleeping facilities in Dortmund in order to immediately end the animal suffering.
2.
Seizure and transfer of the foxes kept in the facilities to specialized animal welfare associations that can ensure humane and stress-free keeping.
3.
A general ban on hunting in Dortmund, as this hunting art is associated with considerable animal suffering and is not ethically justifiable.
4.
Transparency and regular inspections of all animal-keeping facilities by the city of Dortmund, combined with comprehensive public information about such facilities.
5.
Legal improvements at the state level to make the keeping and use of live animals in slaughterhouses binding and to close loopholes in animal welfare laws.
We stand for a city that takes animal welfare seriously and does not tolerate such cruel practices.
The dignity and life of animals must be protected without exception.
Conclusion Dortmund is facing major challenges.
Ecologically, socially and politically, there is a lot of work to be done.
However, we are convinced: a fair, sustainable and compassionate city is possible.
A city in which people, the environment and animals are not played off against each other, but are protected and strengthened together.
With our municipal election program, we show clear, feasible ways to make Dortmund more livable, fairer and more sustainable.
Our politics does not follow any short-term profit thinking, but the principles of responsibility, compassion and ecological reason.
We invite all Dortmunders to be part of this change.
Real change does not start somewhere else, but with ourselves, our environment and what we choose.
If you want to know more about the references, sources and topics that underlie the election program, please contact nrw@tierschutzpartei.de.
Animal protection is human protection.
Climate protection is future protection.
Social cohesion should be the foundation of our city.
With your vote, we can move something together!
