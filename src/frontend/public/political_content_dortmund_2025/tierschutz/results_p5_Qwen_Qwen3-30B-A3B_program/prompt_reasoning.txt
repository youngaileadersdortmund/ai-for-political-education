Okay, I need to figure out the five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by this political program. Let me start by reading through the election program summary carefully.

The party focuses on animal welfare, environmental policy, and social justice. They mention things like public toilets, sound insulation, sustainable practices, green spaces, and reducing pollution. Let me look for keywords related to visual aspects. 

First, "green spaces" and "more greenery" are mentioned, so that's one. Then there's "flowering strips on all green spaces" and "sealing" which relates to urban areas. "Green roofs and facades" are also mentioned, which are visual elements. "Light pollution" is another point, so maybe "reduced light pollution" as a visual aspect. 

They talk about "safe routes to school" and "30 km/h speed limit," which might affect the visual design of streets. "Public transport" and "H-Bahn" could influence the city's infrastructure look. "Dog meadows" and "leash obligation" might change how parks are structured. 

Also, "urban mining" and "de-sealing" could lead to more natural landscapes. "Noise pollution" and "sound insulation" might affect the city's acoustic environment, but visually, maybe the presence of sound barriers or green buffers. 

Wait, the user wants visual aspects. So things like green spaces, green roofs, light pollution, public transport infrastructure, and maybe the presence of dog meadows or playgrounds. Let me check the key points again. 

The program mentions "more greenery and less sealing," "green roofs and facades," "flowering strips," "light pollution," "public transport," "safe routes to school," "dog meadows," "sound insulation," "public toilets," "advertising ban near schools," "school gardens," "urban mining," "sealing" of areas. 

So possible visual aspects: 
1. Increased green spaces and greenery. 
2. Green roofs and facades. 
3. Reduced light pollution. 
4. More public transport infrastructure (like H-Bahn). 
5. Safer, pedestrian-friendly streets with 30 km/h zones. 

Wait, the user wants 5. Let me make sure each is concise and visual. Maybe "Green spaces and greenery expansion" as one. "Green roofs and facades" as another. "Reduced light pollution" as third. "Sustainable public transport infrastructure" as fourth. "Pedestrian-friendly streets with 30 km/h limits" as fifth. 

Alternatively, "More public green areas" and "Urban greening initiatives" could be combined. But need to be concise. Let me check the exact terms from the program. The user wants 3-6 words each. So maybe:

1. Expanded green spaces and greenery
2. Green roofs and facades
3. Reduced light pollution
4. Sustainable public transport infrastructure
5. Pedestrian-friendly streets with 30 km/h zones

That seems to cover the key points. I'll verify if these are all visual aspects. Yes, these are all elements that would change the city's appearance.
