Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program of the Animal Welfare Party in Dortmund and identify 5 important visual aspects of the city's appearance that would be affected by their policies. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the provided program summary and pick out the key points related to the city's visual aspects. The party's focus areas are animal welfare, environmental policy, social justice, and sustainability. 

Looking through the document, I notice several sections. For example, there's mention of "More greenery and less sealing" and "Protection of the urban forest." That points to green spaces and urban forests as visual aspects. Then there's "Flowering strips on all green spaces" and "De-sealing of urban areas," which relates to green infrastructure and reducing sealed surfaces.

Another part talks about "Public transport priority over private cars" and "30 km/h speed limit," which could affect traffic signs and road design. Also, "Safe routes to school" and "Leash obligation in nature reserves" might influence the design of pedestrian zones and signage.

The party also mentions "Green roofs and facades" and "Flowering strips," which are visual elements of buildings and public spaces. Additionally, "Light pollution reduction" and "Conversion of street lamps" relate to lighting and its visual impact.

I need to ensure each of the 5 aspects is a visual element. Let me list possible candidates:

1. Urban green spaces (greenery, parks)
2. Green infrastructure (roofs, facades)
3. Traffic signage and road design (speed limits, pedestrian zones)
4. Public art and cultural installations (art, culture)
5. Lighting and illumination (light pollution, street lamps)

Wait, the user wants 5 aspects. Let me check the program again. There's "More greenery and less sealing" which is about green spaces. "Flowering strips" and "de-sealing" would be part of that. "Green roofs and facades" are another visual aspect. "Light pollution reduction" is another. "Public transport priority" might involve more visible infrastructure like bike lanes or transit stations. "Safe routes to school" could involve pedestrian pathways and signage. "Animal welfare initiatives" like pigeon lofts or feeding areas might be visual.

But the user asked for visual aspects of the city's appearance. So, things like green spaces, traffic infrastructure, lighting, public art, and maybe urban design elements like pedestrian zones. Let me confirm with the program:

- "More greenery and less sealing" → Green spaces
- "Green roofs and facades" → Green infrastructure
- "Light pollution reduction" → Lighting
- "Safe routes to school" → Pedestrian zones
- "Public transport priority" → Transport infrastructure (bike lanes, transit stations)

But the user wants 5. Maybe:

1. Urban green spaces (greenery, parks)
2. Green infrastructure (roofs, facades)
3. Reduced light pollution (lighting)
4. Pedestrian-friendly zones (safe routes, 30 km/h)
5. Public transport visibility (bike lanes, transit signs)

Alternatively, considering the specific points in the program, maybe:

- Green spaces and urban forests
- Green roofs and facades
- Reduced light pollution
- Pedestrian and cycling infrastructure
- Public art and cultural installations

But the program doesn't mention public art explicitly. The party's focus is more on environmental and animal welfare. So maybe:

1. Increased green spaces (more greenery, parks)
2. Green infrastructure (roofs, facades)
3. Reduced light pollution (street lamps, lighting)
4. Pedestrian and cycling zones (safe routes, 30 km/h)
5. Sustainable urban design (de-sealing, flowering strips)

That seems to fit. Each of these is a visual aspect that would change under the party's policies. Now, I need to phrase each in 3-6 words concisely.
