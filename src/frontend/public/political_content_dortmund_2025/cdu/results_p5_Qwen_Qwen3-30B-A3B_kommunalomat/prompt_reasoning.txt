Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the open election compass answers and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by the political program. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words, concise and informative. Then, return them as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to go through the provided answers and pick out the key points that relate to the visual aspects of the city. Let me scan through each of the points mentioned.

Starting with the first one: "All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment." This relates to the interior of schools, but maybe the visual aspect here is the uniformity of school facilities. But maybe not the city's appearance. Wait, the question is about the city's appearance, so maybe more about public spaces, infrastructure, etc.

Next: "All students in the 10th grade should receive information about professions and voluntary services from the city of Dortmund – also in writing." This is more about education and information, not directly visual.

"The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities offered by clubs and the city." Again, info dissemination, not visual.

"The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly, especially after weekends." Cleaning of school exteriors could affect the city's appearance, so maybe "Clean school exteriors" as a visual aspect.

"There should be free learning and education opportunities for young people in every district." This is about accessibility, maybe not visual.

"The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries." Libraries are public spaces, so "Expanded public libraries" could be a visual aspect.

"Every school should have a tandem of school social work and school psychologists." This is about services, not visual.

"The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people." Again, services, not visual.

"Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes." Bike parking would affect the city's infrastructure, so "Increased bike parking facilities."

"Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer." Safer cycle paths would involve visual elements like colored markings, so "Safer cycle paths with markings."

"Buses and trains are to run more frequently..." This is about transportation frequency, not visual.

"The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections." Tram connections could change the city's layout, but maybe "Improved tram connectivity" as a visual aspect.

"Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted." Restricting taxis might affect the visual clutter around schools, but maybe "Reduced parent taxi congestion."

"Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations." Emergency buttons are more about safety, not visual.

"Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded." This involves infrastructure, so "Expanded safe pedestrian/cyclist routes."

"Sports boxes are to be installed in every district." Sports boxes are physical structures, so "District sports boxes."

"The city of Dortmund is to provide suitable plots of land for new clubs and discos." Land plots for clubs could affect the city's layout, but maybe "New club/disco venues."

"The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas of the districts." Wi-Fi is more about services, not visual.

"An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up." Digital portal, not visual.

"The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted." Restaurants as physical structures, so "More restaurant developments."

"The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate." Participation formats, not visual.

"Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning..." Involving youth in planning, which could affect future city designs, but maybe "Youth-influenced urban planning."

"The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics." Digital offers, not visual.

"People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses." Employment, not visual.

"Separate homes are to be built for trainees." Trainee housing, so "New apprentice housing."

"Offers for young people are to be created in every district." More facilities, so "Youth-focused district facilities."

"The city of Dortmund should provide its own rooms for all groups and associations." Rooms for groups, maybe "Dedicated community rooms."

"The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures." Funding, not visual.

"The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language." Multilingual info, not visual.

"More public litter bins are to be installed in the city." Litter bins are public infrastructure, so "Increased public litter bins."

"Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces." Drinking fountains, so "Hygienic public water fountains."

"Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade." Planting trees, so "More public shade trees."

"Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels." Solar panels on buildings, so "Solar panel installations."

"The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center." Public toilets, so "More public restrooms."

"Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night." Patrols, not visual.

"All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism." Training, not visual.

"Inclusive offers for children with and without disabilities are to be provided in all schools in Dortmund." Inclusive facilities, so "Inclusive school facilities."

"Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free." Barrier-free facilities, so "Barrier-free leisure facilities."

"More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people." Inclusive offers, not visual.

"Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices." Support services, not visual.

"Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way." Accessibility, not visual.

Now, from all these, I need to pick five that are visual aspects of the city's appearance. Let's see:

1. Clean school exteriors (from "outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly")
2. Expanded public libraries (from establishing more public learning spaces)
3. Increased bike parking facilities (more bike parking spaces)
4. Safer cycle paths with markings (cycle paths made safer with colored markings)
5. More public shade trees (planting trees for shade)

Wait, but some of these might not be directly visual. For example, "clean school exteriors" is about cleanliness, which is a visual aspect. "Expanded public libraries" would be visible structures. "Increased bike parking" is physical infrastructure. "Safer cycle paths with markings" involves visual elements like colored markings. "More public shade trees" is planting trees, which changes the city's greenery.

Alternatively, maybe "Improved tram connectivity" is about transportation infrastructure, which is visual. "District sports boxes" as physical structures. "New apprentice housing" as buildings. "More restaurant developments" as new buildings. "Hygienic public water fountains" as installations. "Solar panel installations" on buildings. "More public restrooms" as structures.

But the user asked for 5. Let me check the original answers again for the most direct visual aspects.

Looking at the points again:

- "The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly..." → Clean school exteriors
- "The city of Dortmund should establish more public learning spaces like libraries." → Expanded public libraries
- "Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes." → Increased bike parking facilities
- "Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer..." → Safer cycle paths with markings
- "Trees are to be planted in public spaces..." → More public shade trees
- "More public litter bins are to be installed..." → Increased public litter bins
- "Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available..." → Hygienic public water fountains
- "Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels." → Solar panel installations
- "The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets..." → More public restrooms

So from these, the top 5 visual aspects would be:

1. Clean school exteriors
2. Expanded public libraries
3. Increased bike parking facilities
4. Safer cycle paths with markings
5. More public shade trees

Alternatively, maybe "Improved tram connectivity" is a visual aspect, but it's more about infrastructure. "District sports boxes" could be another. But the user wants 5. Let me check if these five are covered in the answers.

Yes, the above five are all directly mentioned in the answers. So I'll go with those.
