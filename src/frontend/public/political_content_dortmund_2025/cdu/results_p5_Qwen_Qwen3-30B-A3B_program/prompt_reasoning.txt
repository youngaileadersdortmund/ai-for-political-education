Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the CDU election program summary and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by their policies. Each aspect needs to be a concise 3-6 word description, separated by commas.

First, I need to go through the provided text and pick out key points related to the city's visual aspects. The program mentions things like revitalizing the city center, improving public spaces, infrastructure, housing, and environmental initiatives. 

Looking for visual elements: "lively squares" and "attractive shops" are mentioned, so maybe "Revitalized City Center" or "Lively Public Squares". Then there's talk about "green roofs" and "energy-efficient renovation", which could relate to "Green Infrastructure". 

The part about "safe streets" and "security" might point to "Enhanced Public Safety Features". The "cycle paths" and "public transport" improvements could be "Improved Mobility Infrastructure". Also, "newPark" and "green spaces" might lead to "Expanded Green Spaces". 

Wait, need to make sure each is a visual aspect. Let me check again. The user wants aspects that are visually noticeable. So, "Lively Public Squares" is good. "Revitalized City Center" makes sense. "Green Infrastructure" covers the energy-efficient and green roofs. "Enhanced Public Safety Features" like better lighting or signage. "Improved Mobility Infrastructure" for bike lanes and public transport. 

I need to ensure they are concise and within 3-6 words. Let me list possible options:

1. Revitalized City Center
2. Lively Public Squares
3. Green Infrastructure
4. Enhanced Public Safety
5. Improved Mobility Networks

Wait, the user might prefer terms like "Safe Streets" instead of "Enhanced Public Safety". Also, "Expanded Green Spaces" instead of "Green Infrastructure". Need to pick the most relevant ones from the text. The program mentions "lively squares", "safe streets", "green roofs", "cycle paths", "public transport", "newPark", "green spaces". 

So, possible 5:

1. Revitalized City Center
2. Lively Public Squares
3. Green Infrastructure
4. Safe Streets
5. Expanded Green Spaces

Alternatively, "Improved Mobility Infrastructure" for the bike paths and public transport. But "Improved Mobility Networks" might be better. Let me check the exact phrases. The text says "cycle paths, sidewalks, public transport", so maybe "Enhanced Mobility Infrastructure". 

But the user wants concise. Maybe "Improved Mobility Infrastructure" is 5 words. Alternatively, "Bike & Ride Facilities" but that's specific. The main ones are the city center, public squares, green spaces, safe streets, and mobility. 

I think that's a solid list. Let me confirm each is directly mentioned or implied. Yes, the CDU talks about revitalizing the city center, lively squares, green roofs (part of green infrastructure), safe streets, and improving mobility. Also, "newPark" and "green spaces" are mentioned. So the final list would be those five.
