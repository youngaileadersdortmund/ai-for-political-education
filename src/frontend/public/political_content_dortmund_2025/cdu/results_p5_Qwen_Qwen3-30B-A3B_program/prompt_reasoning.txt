Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by this political program. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the provided text and pick out the key points related to the city's appearance. The CDU's program mentions several areas like urban development, infrastructure, public spaces, environmental initiatives, and more. 

Looking at the sections about the city center, they talk about making it inviting with lively squares, attractive shops, and safe streets. That points to "Lively public squares" as a visual aspect. Then there's mention of green roofs and energy-efficient buildings, so "Green roofs and energy-efficient buildings" could be another. 

The part about the former HSP area and newPark project suggests urban redevelopment, so "Urban redevelopment projects" might fit. The program also mentions improving cycle paths and public transport, which relates to "Improved cycling and pedestrian infrastructure." 

Another point is the focus on social cohesion and community centers, which could translate to "Community centers and public forums." But I need to check if that's visual. Alternatively, the mention of "safe streets" and "cleanliness" might relate to "Clean and safe streets." 

Wait, the user wants visual aspects. So maybe "Lively public squares" is good. "Attractive shops" could be part of the city center. Also, the "digital map" for cycle routes might not be visual. The "green roofs" and "energy-efficient buildings" are definitely visual. 

Another aspect is the "redevelopment of the former HSP area" and "newPark" project, which would change the city's look. So "Urban redevelopment projects" is solid. 

The "cycle routes" and "bike & ride facilities" would affect the visual infrastructure. "Improved cycling and pedestrian infrastructure" works. 

The "safe streets" and "cleanliness" are part of the security and order goals. "Clean and safe streets" is concise. 

Also, the "energy-efficient renovation of houses" and "green roofs" are visual. So combining those into "Green roofs and energy-efficient buildings." 

Another point is the "digitalization strategy" and "smart city" initiatives, but that's more about technology than visual aspects. 

The "family card" and cultural facilities might relate to "Cultural and leisure facilities," but that's more about services than visual. 

So compiling the five: Lively public squares, Green roofs and energy-efficient buildings, Urban redevelopment projects, Improved cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, Clean and safe streets. 

I need to check if these are all visual. Yes, they all relate to the physical appearance of the city. Each is 3-6 words. That should cover it.
