Approval - 

Buses and trains are to run more frequently - especially during rush hour and at night.:
Approval - The bottleneck here is less the money than the lack of drivers, and while we are in favour of expanding this, it must be clear that this can only be done gradually - as was the case recently with the extended operating hours of the Stadtbahn at night.

The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections:
Approval - There are important light rail expansion projects. However, these require a very long lead time. We see short-term solutions for connecting the outer city districts more in better bus connections and in ride sharing, i.e. digitally coordinated shared taxis.

Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted.:
Approval - 

Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations:
Strong Approval -

Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade:

Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels.:
Approval - To this end, the FDP in the council in the last election period initiated the examination of the specific structural possibilities. The installation should take place within the scope of the financial possibilities. However, this should not be at the expense of the renovation of classrooms, roofs or toilet facilities in schools.

The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center:
Strong Approval - 

Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night:
