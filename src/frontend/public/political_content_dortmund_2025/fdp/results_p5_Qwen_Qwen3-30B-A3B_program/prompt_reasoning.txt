Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary of the Free Democrats in Dortmund and identify five important visual aspects of the city's appearance that would be affected by their policies. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words, as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to read through the provided program summary carefully. The main points seem to cover various areas like economy, administration, law enforcement, education, social services, urban development, transportation, and public spaces. My task is to focus on the visual aspects. So, I need to think about elements that are visible in the city's appearance and how the policies might influence them.

Starting with the economy part: they mention streamlining procedures, digitalization, and supporting SMEs. But how does that translate to visual aspects? Maybe not directly, but when they talk about city partnerships and international projects, that might affect the city's branding or public spaces. However, maybe not the most visual.

Looking at urban development: "More urban greening, aesthetic urban furniture and arrangements for the summer are just as important as the renovation of the paving in the pedestrian zone." So urban greening and aesthetic furniture are visual. That's one point: Urban Greening and Aesthetic Furniture.

Then, the part about pedestrian zones and traffic light switches. They want to prioritize pedestrian zones and review traffic lights for pedestrians. That would affect the design of sidewalks, crosswalks, maybe the presence of pedestrian areas. So Pedestrian-Friendly Zones and Crosswalk Enhancements.

Another part mentions "open spaces should only be developed if necessary" and "special efforts for the city center to make it the 'living room of Dortmund'". So maybe improvements in public spaces and city center aesthetics. But the user asked for visual aspects, so maybe City Center Aesthetics or Public Space Upgrades.

They also talk about outdoor catering and allowing fixed patio installations. That would change the look of sidewalks and streets with more outdoor seating areas. So Outdoor Seating Areas.

Another point is about the Stadtbahn expansion and public transport. While that's more infrastructure, maybe the visual aspect is the expansion of public transport infrastructure, like new tram lines or stations. But the user might be looking for more immediate visual changes. Alternatively, the mention of "financial incentives instead of compulsion" for building requirements might lead to more open spaces or less cluttered areas. But I need to check the exact phrases.

Also, the part about "compulsory greening of roofs" being abolished. If they remove that requirement, maybe more rooftop areas are used for other purposes, but that's a bit abstract. Alternatively, the "abandoning building-hindering requirements" could lead to more open spaces or different building designs, but again, not sure.

Looking at the transportation section: "free parking in the evenings" for gastronomy. That might affect the visual aspect of parking areas, maybe more parking spaces or changes in how parking is managed. But parking isn't a visual aspect per se. Maybe not.

Another part: "care of green spaces in the streets into the hands of private gardening companies in exchange for advertising opportunities." That could lead to more branded or commercialized green spaces, which is a visual change. So Commercialized Green Spaces.

But the user wants five. Let me list possible ones:

1. Urban Greening and Aesthetic Furniture (from the city center part)
2. Pedestrian-Friendly Zones and Crosswalk Enhancements (from the pedestrian priority)
3. Outdoor Seating Areas (from allowing patios)
4. City Center Aesthetics (from the 'living room' concept)
5. Commercialized Green Spaces (from private gardening companies)

Alternatively, maybe "Public Space Upgrades" instead of city center aesthetics. Also, the part about "renovation of the paving in the pedestrian zone" could be Paved Pedestrian Zones.

Wait, the user said "visual aspects of a city appearance". So things like streets, buildings, public spaces, signage, etc. Let me check again.

From the program:

- "More urban greening, aesthetic urban furniture and arrangements for the summer are just as important as the renovation of the paving in the pedestrian zone." → Urban Greening, Aesthetic Furniture, Paved Pedestrian Zones.

- "Outdoor catering should be made possible wherever possible. Restaurants and pubs should be given the opportunity to set up fixed patio installations on sidewalks in certain areas." → Outdoor Seating Areas.

- "We want to give pedestrian zones in Dortmund a higher priority." → Pedestrian Zones.

- "The care of green spaces in the streets into the hands of private gardening companies in exchange for advertising opportunities." → Commercialized Green Spaces.

- "The city should set financial incentives instead of compulsion." Maybe leading to more open spaces or different designs, but not sure. Alternatively, "Abolition of Compulsory Greening" (if they remove the requirement for roof greening, but that's more about regulations than visual appearance).

Another part: "All building-hindering and building-increasing requirements of the city, such as the compulsory greening of roofs, must be abolished." So removing compulsory greening might lead to less green roofs, which is a visual aspect. But maybe the opposite: if they abolish the requirement, there might be more open roofs, but not sure. Alternatively, the visual aspect could be "Reduced Green Roof Mandates".

But the user wants concise descriptions. Let me pick the five that are most clearly mentioned.

1. Urban Greening and Aesthetic Furniture
2. Pedestrian-Friendly Zones
3. Outdoor Seating Areas
4. City Center Aesthetics
5. Commercialized Green Spaces

Alternatively, "Paved Pedestrian Zones" instead of City Center Aesthetics. But the city center part mentions more than just paving. Maybe "City Center Revitalization" but that's a bit vague.

I think the five I listed are solid. Let me check the word count. Each is 3-6 words. Yes. So the final answer would be those five as a comma-separated list.
