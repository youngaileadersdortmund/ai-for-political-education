Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary from the Free Democrats in Dortmund and identify five important visual aspects of the city's appearance that would be affected by their policies. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the program carefully. The key points mentioned are about streamlining bureaucracy, digitalization, supporting SMEs, city partnerships, cultural and technological factors, infrastructure investments, public services, youth participation, diversity, and urban planning. 

Looking for visual aspects, I should think about elements that are directly related to the city's look. For example, digitalization might affect public services, which could be seen in digital signage or kiosks. The mention of pedestrian zones and traffic light reviews suggests changes to sidewalks and crosswalks. The Stadtbahn expansion and public transport improvements might involve new infrastructure like tram stops or bike lanes. The part about green spaces and urban furniture relates to parks and public areas. Also, the mention of outdoor catering and fixed patio installations would affect the streetscape with more seating areas. 

I need to make sure each point is a visual aspect. Let me list possible ones:

1. Digital signage in public services (from digitalization of processes)
2. Pedestrian zones with improved crosswalks (from traffic light reviews and pedestrian priority)
3. Stadtbahn expansion (new tram infrastructure)
4. Urban greening and public furniture (for the city center)
5. Outdoor seating areas for restaurants (patio installations)

Check if these are covered in the text. The program does mention digitalization, pedestrian zones, Stadtbahn, urban greening, and outdoor catering. Each of these would have a visual impact. Now, condense each into 3-6 words. 

Digital signage in public services → "Digital signage in public services"
Pedestrian zones with improved crosswalks → "Enhanced pedestrian zones"
Stadtbahn expansion → "Stadtbahn expansion infrastructure"
Urban greening and public furniture → "Urban greening and public furniture"
Outdoor seating areas → "Outdoor dining patios"

Wait, the user wants a comma-separated list. Let me verify each point is a visual aspect. Yes, these all relate to the city's appearance. I think that's five. Make sure each is concise and within the word limit. Looks good.
