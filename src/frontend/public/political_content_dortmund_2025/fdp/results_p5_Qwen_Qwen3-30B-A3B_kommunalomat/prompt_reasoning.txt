Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the given open election compass answers and identify 5 important visual aspects of a city's appearance affected by the political program. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words, concise and informative. Then, return them as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to go through each of the provided answers and look for elements that relate to the visual aspects of the city. Let me start by scanning each point.

1. "All classrooms in municipal schools should be equipped with the same furniture and digital equipment" – This affects the uniformity and modernization of school interiors, but maybe not the city's appearance directly. However, if all schools have the same look, it might contribute to a more cohesive visual style in educational areas.

2. "The city of Dortmund should inform schools about leisure activities..." – This is more about information and programs, not visual aspects.

3. "The outside areas of schools should be cleaned regularly..." – Cleanliness of school exteriors could impact the overall appearance of those areas, contributing to a tidier cityscape.

4. "The city of Dortmund should create more offers for the mental health of young people" – Again, more about services than visual elements.

5. "Dortmund is to have more bike parking spaces for rental bikes" – Increased bike parking would change the landscape of streets and public areas, adding bike racks and possibly altering traffic flow visuals.

6. "Cycle paths in Dortmund must be made safer" – Safer cycle paths might involve better signage, lighting, or physical barriers, which are visual elements.

7. "Buses and trains are to run more frequently..." – More frequent public transport might not directly affect the city's visual aspects, but maybe more buses on the roads?

8. "The outer districts of Dortmund are to be better connected by new tram connections" – New trams and tracks would definitely change the visual landscape, adding tram lines and stations.

9. "Parent taxis in front of schools and daycare centers are to be restricted" – This could lead to changes in traffic patterns and possibly more pedestrian areas, affecting the visual of school zones.

10. "Functioning emergency call buttons should be available at all train stations" – More buttons on stations, which are part of the station's design.

11. "Safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists are to be expanded" – Expanding these routes would involve adding or improving sidewalks, bike lanes, which are visual elements.

12. "The city of Dortmund should also provide free Wi-Fi in all central areas..." – Wi-Fi infrastructure might not be visually prominent, but maybe more public terminals or signage.

13. "An online portal with leisure and educational offers for young people is to be set up" – Digital, not visual.

14. "The establishment of restaurants in the outskirts is to be promoted" – More restaurants could change the commercial areas' appearance, adding new buildings or signs.

15. "The city should design participation formats in such a way that all groups can participate" – Not visual.

16. "Young people should be allowed to have a say in town planning..." – Involving youth in planning might lead to more youth-friendly designs, but not sure about the visual aspects.

17. "The city wants to promote digital offers so that young people can learn about politics" – Digital, not visual.

18. "People with disabilities should be specifically employed in urban businesses" – Not directly visual.

19. "Separate homes are to be built for trainees" – New housing structures, which are visual.

20. "Offers for young people are to be created in every district" – More facilities, which could be visual.

21. "The city of Dortmund should actively acquire further funding from the federal government and the state for social measures" – Funding, not visual.

22. "The city should also provide important information in English, Turkish, Arabic and in simple language." – Signage in multiple languages, which is visual.

23. "More public litter bins are to be installed in the city" – More bins, changing the city's appearance with more trash receptacles.

24. "Hygienic drinking fountains are to be made available in public spaces" – Fountains as public amenities, adding to the visual of public areas.

25. "Trees are to be planted in public spaces to provide more shade" – More trees, which are a significant visual aspect of a city's landscape.

26. "Schools and public buildings are to be increasingly equipped with solar panels" – Solar panels on buildings, changing their appearance.

27. "The city of Dortmund is to set up additional public toilets in the city center" – More toilets, which are structures in public areas.

28. "Security forces are to be on patrol in all underground trains at night" – More security presence, but not sure about visual impact.

29. "All employees of the police and the public order office are to receive compulsory training on racism" – Training, not visual.

30. "In Dortmund, more safe places and offers for queer youth are to be created" – Safe places might be specific facilities, affecting the visual landscape.

31. "Employees in schools and youth facilities should be trained in diversity and queerness" – Training, not visual.

32. "Leisure facilities such as youth centres or sports halls are to be designed to be barrier-free" – Barrier-free design, which includes accessibility features like ramps, which are visual.

33. "More inclusive holiday offers are to be offered in Dortmund for children and young people" – Not directly visual.

34. "Young people with disabilities should receive targeted support in their career choices" – Not visual.

35. "Additional costs for care and transport on school trips should be accessible in a barrier-free and unbureaucratic way" – Not visual.

Now, from these, I need to pick 5 visual aspects. Let me list the possible ones:

- More bike parking spaces (bike racks, visual change in public areas)
- Safer cycle paths (signage, barriers, lighting)
- New tram connections (tracks, stations)
- More trees (greenery, urban landscape)
- Solar panels on buildings (visible installations)
- Public litter bins (additional structures)
- Drinking fountains (public amenities)
- Barrier-free design (ramps, accessible features)
- More restaurants (new buildings, signs)
- Multilingual signage (language on signs)
- Additional public toilets (new structures)
- Expanded pedestrian/cyclist routes (sidewalks, bike lanes)

Now, which of these are the most significant and directly related to the city's appearance? Let's prioritize:

1. **More bike parking spaces** – Visual change with bike racks.
2. **Safer cycle paths** – Visual elements like signage, barriers.
3. **New tram connections** – Tram tracks and stations.
4. **More trees** – Urban greening.
5. **Solar panels on buildings** – Visible installations on rooftops.

Alternatively, maybe **barrier-free design** (ramps, tactile paving) and **multilingual signage**. But the user asked for 5. Let me check if these are covered in the answers.

Yes, the answers mention:

- More bike parking spaces
- Cycle paths made safer
- New tram connections
- Trees planted
- Solar panels on schools and buildings
- Public litter bins
- Drinking fountains
- Barrier-free design (leisure facilities)
- Multilingual signage
- Additional public toilets

So, from these, the top 5 visual aspects would be:

1. **Expanded bike parking infrastructure** – Bike racks, stations.
2. **Safer cycle path design** – Signage, barriers, lighting.
3. **New tram network installations** – Tracks, stations.
4. **Increased urban greenery** – Trees, parks.
5. **Solar panel installations on buildings** – Rooftops, visible panels.

Alternatively, maybe **barrier-free public spaces** (ramps, tactile paving) and **multilingual signage**. But the user might prefer the first five. Need to ensure each is concise and within 3-6 words.

Final list:

Expanded bike parking, safer cycle paths, new tram infrastructure, urban greenery, solar panel installations.
