Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary from the Free Democrats in Dortmund and identify five important visual aspects of the city's appearance that would be affected by their policies. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the summary carefully. The program covers various areas: economy, administration, public services, infrastructure, transportation, urban planning, etc. The key is to focus on the visual aspects. So, I should look for parts that mention things like streets, buildings, public spaces, signage, green areas, etc.

Starting with the economy and administration part: "streamline and speed up procedures by removing bureaucratic hurdles and increasing the digitalisation of processes." That might affect the look of city offices, maybe making them more efficient, but not sure if that's visual. Then, "digitalisation must be designed without media breaks" – maybe digital signage or information kiosks? But not sure if that's a visual aspect of the city's appearance.

Looking at the part about urban services and public spaces: "Open spaces should only be developed if this is absolutely necessary..." and "More urban greening, aesthetic urban furniture..." So urban greening and aesthetic furniture are definitely visual. That's one aspect: urban greening and aesthetic furniture.

Then, "The city should set financial incentives instead of compulsion." Maybe that relates to how public spaces are maintained, but not sure. "All building-hindering and building-increasing requirements... must be abolished." So maybe less strict building codes, leading to more open spaces or different architectural styles. But not sure if that's a visual aspect.

The part about pedestrian zones: "We want to give pedestrian zones in Dortmund a higher priority." So more pedestrian areas, which would change the visual layout of the city, maybe more walkable streets, less cars. That's another aspect: pedestrian zones and walkable streets.

Then, "maintenance must be given priority over new construction." So better maintenance of existing infrastructure, which could affect the appearance of streets, buildings, etc. But maybe that's more about upkeep than visual aspects. However, well-maintained areas are visually appealing. So maybe "well-maintained infrastructure" as an aspect.

Another part: "The Stadtbahn expansion program... connection of the H-Bahn to the U42..." Public transport expansion might involve new stations or tracks, which are visual. But the user wants aspects of the city's appearance, so maybe "public transport infrastructure" as a visual aspect.

Also, "Restaurants and pubs should be given the opportunity to set up fixed patio installations..." So more outdoor seating areas, which would change the streetscape. That's another visual aspect: outdoor dining areas.

Looking at the part about "the care of green spaces in the streets into the hands of private gardening companies..." So maybe more green areas, which ties back to urban greening. But I already considered that.

Another point: "The city needs an independent pedestrian officer..." Not sure about the visual aspect here. Maybe "pedestrian-friendly design" as a visual aspect.

Also, "All traffic light switches must be reviewed in favour of pedestrians..." So traffic lights adjusted for pedestrians, which might involve new signage or crosswalks. That could be part of pedestrian-friendly design.

So compiling these thoughts, the five aspects could be:

1. Urban greening and aesthetic furniture (from the part about more green spaces and urban furniture)
2. Pedestrian zones and walkable streets (from prioritizing pedestrian areas)
3. Outdoor dining areas (from allowing patio installations)
4. Public transport infrastructure (from Stadtbahn and H-Bahn expansion)
5. Well-maintained infrastructure (from prioritizing maintenance over new construction)

Wait, but the user wants 5 aspects. Let me check again. The user's example response might have different terms. Let me verify the original text again.

Looking at the original text, under the part about "The city should set financial incentives instead of compulsion." Maybe that relates to more private involvement in maintaining public spaces, which could lead to more private gardens or advertising, but not sure. 

Another part: "The Stadtbahn expansion program... connection of the H-Bahn to the U42..." So new public transport infrastructure, which is a visual aspect.

Also, "The car is still an equal partner in mobility..." but the user might not want that as a visual aspect. 

Another part: "The city of Dortmund should expand its engagement in the municipal diplomacy." Not sure about visual aspects here.

"Culture and creative industries are a key factor..." So maybe more cultural spaces, but not sure if that's a visual aspect. 

"More urban greening, aesthetic urban furniture..." So that's definitely a visual aspect. 

"Renovation of the paving in the pedestrian zone." So renovated sidewalks, which is a visual aspect. 

"Open spaces should only be developed if necessary..." So preserving open spaces, which affects the city's appearance. 

"Free parking in the evenings" for gastronomy, which might lead to more parking areas, but not sure if that's a visual aspect. 

"Care of green spaces in the streets into the hands of private gardening companies..." So more private gardens, which could be visual. 

Putting it all together, the five aspects could be:

1. Urban greening and aesthetic furniture
2. Pedestrian zones and walkable streets
3. Outdoor dining areas
4. Public transport infrastructure
5. Well-maintained infrastructure

Alternatively, maybe "reduced building restrictions" if they abolish building-hindering requirements. But that's more about regulations than visual aspects. 

Another possibility: "Modernized digital signage" from the digitalization part. But the text says "digitalisation must be designed without media breaks," which might mean seamless integration, but not sure. 

Alternatively, "Enhanced public art installations" if they mention culture, but the text says "culture and creative industries are key," but not sure if that's visual. 

I think the five I have are the most solid. Let me check the word count. Each needs 3-6 words. 

Urban greening and aesthetic furniture (7 words) – maybe shorten to "Urban greening and furniture" (5 words). 

Pedestrian zones and walkable streets (6 words). 

Outdoor dining areas (4 words). 

Public transport infrastructure (5 words). 

Well-maintained infrastructure (5 words). 

That's five. Alternatively, "Pedestrian-friendly design" instead of "Pedestrian zones and walkable streets" to make it 4 words. 

But the user might prefer more specific terms. So the final answer would be these five, each concise.
