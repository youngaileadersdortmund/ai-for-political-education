Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary for Dortmund and identify 5 important visual aspects of the city's appearance that would be affected by the SPD's program. Each aspect needs to be a concise description, 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the provided text carefully. The program covers various areas like housing, education, transportation, public spaces, and environmental initiatives. My task is to pick out the visual elements that would change. 

Starting with housing: The SPD mentions building more socially and affordably, with 30% public housing. That might lead to more public housing developments, so "Public housing developments" could be one.

Next, transportation: They talk about expanding bike lanes, improving public transport, and making bus stops accessible. "Expanded bike lanes" and "Accessible public transport" come to mind. But I need to check if these are visual aspects. Bike lanes are definitely visual, and accessible features like ramps or tactile paving would be visible.

Education: The program includes school construction, full-day schools, and modernizing facilities. "Modernized school facilities" is a good fit.

Public spaces: There's mention of playgrounds, green areas, and making streets cleaner. "Green spaces and parks" and "Cleaner streets" could work. Also, "Barrier-free playgrounds" since they involve design changes.

Environmental initiatives: Sponge city concepts, more permeable surfaces, solar panels. "Solar panel installations" and "Water-permeable surfaces" are visual. But I need to pick the top 5.

Wait, the user wants 5. Let me list possible ones:

1. Public housing developments
2. Expanded bike lanes
3. Modernized school facilities
4. Green spaces and parks
5. Barrier-free playgrounds

Alternatively, maybe "Accessible public transport" instead of bike lanes. But bike lanes are a clear visual. Also, "Cleaner streets" could be another. But I need to ensure they are directly impacted by the program. The program mentions road offensive, cleaning, and litter reduction, so "Cleaner streets" is valid. 

Another point: "Digital city map" might not be visual. "Smart city infrastructure" could be, but maybe not as direct. 

I think the five I listed are solid. Let me check the original text again to confirm. Yes, the program talks about building more housing, expanding bike lanes, modernizing schools, creating green spaces, and barrier-free playgrounds. These are all visual aspects. So the final answer would be those five, separated by commas.
