Okay, I need to figure out 10 impact points from the given election program summary for Dortmund. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.

The program mentions several key areas: housing, climate change, mobility, unemployment, digital infrastructure, public services, social inclusion, and cultural offerings. Each of these seems like a potential impact point. But I need to make sure they are specific to local aspects.

First, the housing section talks about eliminating profit pressure and creating a non-profit sector. That could be an impact point about housing affordability and non-profit housing initiatives. Then there's the climate action part, like making the city climate-proof and reducing CO2 emissions. That's another point.

Mobility is mentioned with reducing heavy traffic and expanding public transport. The 365-euro ticket for the Ruhr area is a specific goal. Digital infrastructure is a priority with fiber optics and 5G. Public spaces and retail are connected, so maybe that's another point. Social inclusion and combating loneliness, especially with the first staff unit in Germany. 

Children's programs and education, like free access to swimming pools and schools. Cultural initiatives, like free access for kids and new payment models for events. Public services digitalization by 2030. Also, the police presence and dealing with neo-Nazis as part of social safety.

Wait, the user wants 10. Let me pick the most distinct ones. Maybe:

1. Non-profit housing sector (housing affordability)
2. Climate-proof city planning (climate resilience)
3. Public transport expansion (mobility)
4. Digital infrastructure (fiber, 5G)
5. Social inclusion and anti-neo-Nazi efforts (safety)
6. Children's access to culture and sports (youth)
7. Free public services (digitalization)
8. Reducing heavy traffic (mobility)
9. Combating loneliness (social welfare)
10. Cultural offerings and accessibility (culture)

Now, for each, I need a short identifier, description, importance weight, and reasoning. Importance between 0-1. Let me think about the reasoning. For example, non-profit housing is crucial for affordability, so high importance. Climate action is important for sustainability, maybe 0.9. Public transport and mobility are key for daily life, 0.8. Digital infrastructure is vital for modern services, 0.8. Social inclusion and safety are essential for community, 0.8. Children's access is important for future, 0.7. Free services for equity, 0.7. Traffic reduction for health and environment, 0.7. Combating loneliness is a social issue, 0.6. Cultural access for community engagement, 0.6.

I need to make sure the descriptions don't have quotes. Also, check that each impact point is specific and local. Maybe adjust some names for clarity. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.
