Okay, let's see. The user provided a detailed election program summary for Dortmund and wants me to list the key visual aspects that would change in the city based on this program. They want only the visual aspects, comma-separated, no extra info.

First, I need to go through the text and pick out the parts that mention physical changes or improvements that would be visible. Let me scan through each section.

Starting with the housing part: "build 2,000 new and affordable apartments," "energy efficient buildings," "municipal service company," "prevent speculation with land," "master planning for housing" creating neighborhoods. So that would lead to new residential areas, more affordable housing, energy-efficient buildings, maybe more mixed-use neighborhoods.

Then the climate plan: "reduce CO2 emissions," "improve parks, gardens, allotments," "close coal-fired power plant," "climate-proof city." Visual changes here could be more green spaces, maybe more trees, renovated parks, maybe solar panels on buildings, removal of old power plants.

Logistics and transport: "improve public transport and cycle path network," "new electric buses and trains," "digital public transport," "365-euro ticket." So more bike lanes, new public transport infrastructure, electric vehicles, maybe more stations or routes.

Economy and local trade: "strengthen local economy," "local retail needs public space," "high-speed city." This might mean more vibrant public spaces, maybe more shops, pedestrian zones, or areas designed for local businesses.

Craftsmanship and municipal contracts: "develop municipal contracts," "local jobs." Not sure if this is visual, but maybe more local businesses, which could affect the cityscape with more shops or community centers.

Social aspects: "campaign to reduce dirt," "cleanliness," "combat loneliness," "social index." Visual changes here could be cleaner streets, more public cleanliness initiatives, maybe more community spaces or social facilities.

Education and childcare: "equip schools with WLAN," "free meals," "summer programs," "children's music festival," "youth film festival." This might lead to more educational facilities, public event spaces, maybe new community centers or cultural venues.

Health program: "improve care close to home," "focus on housing, education, mobility." Maybe more healthcare facilities, better access to services, which could be visible as new buildings or improved infrastructure.

Culture: "open access to culture," "nightlife improvements," "new experiences," "festivals." This could mean more cultural venues, art installations, event spaces, maybe more vibrant nightlife areas.

Digitization: "digitize all municipal services," "online platforms." Not sure if visual, but maybe more digital kiosks or tech installations in public areas.

Tax and services: "keep tax burden stable," "abolish Local Rates Act." Not sure about visual aspects here, maybe not relevant.

Putting it all together, the visual aspects would include new affordable housing developments, energy-efficient buildings, expanded green spaces and parks, improved public transport infrastructure (bike lanes, electric buses), more vibrant public spaces for local trade, cultural venues and event areas, cleaner streets and public areas, possibly more community centers or social facilities, and maybe new educational or health facilities. Also, the removal of the coal plant might change the skyline, and the climate-proofing could involve more sustainable urban design elements.

I need to make sure I'm only listing visual changes. Avoid things like policies or programs unless they directly translate to physical changes. For example, "master planning for housing" leads to neighborhoods, which is visual. "Cleanliness campaign" would mean cleaner streets, so that's visual. "Cycle path network" is physical. "Digital public transport" might involve new infrastructure like stations or vehicles. "Children's music festival" would be events, but maybe the infrastructure for that, like venues. 

So compiling all these, the list would be things like new affordable housing, energy-efficient buildings, expanded parks, improved public transport infrastructure, more bike lanes, vibrant public spaces, cultural venues, cleaner streets, community centers, educational facilities, health facilities, and maybe sustainable urban design elements. Also, the removal of the coal plant would be a visual change. 

I should check if all these are explicitly mentioned. The text mentions "energy efficient buildings," "parks, gardens and allotments," "cycle path network," "public transport," "cleanliness campaign," "neighborhoods for families, young singles, couples," "climate-proof," "cultural venues," "summer programs," "festivals," "community centers" (from the loneliness program), "healthcare facilities," etc. 

Yes, so the key visual aspects would be:

new affordable housing developments, energy-efficient buildings, expanded green spaces, improved public transport infrastructure, more bike lanes, vibrant public spaces, cultural venues, cleaner streets, community centers, educational facilities, health facilities, climate-proof urban design, and removal of coal-fired power plant.
