TEAM  DORTMUND PROGRAM  FOR THE 2020 LOCAL  ELECTIONS2 1.T E A MD O R T M A N D The new decade  needs  new answers.  We have had a clear compass  in Dortmund  for 74 years:  solidarity  and progress. After our city was destroyed  as a result of National  Socialist  barbarism,  we rebuilt  it together.  The year 1966, when BVB Liverpool  in the final, was our  first big year. When  the first clouds  of crisis came shortly  afterwards,  we built the first university.  After that, we not only turned  the sky blue again,   but also  new work into the city. When the other crises came and the big companies  disappeared,  we as a city always  found an answer,  from the  Westfalenh√ºtte  to the technology  center  to the PHOENIX  lake. Dortmund  was often pronounced  dead and we always  got up again. We achieved  all of this together  in Dortmund,  and the SPD was not the only party involved.  But we never ran away from responsibility.  We  wanted  it and received  the trust for it. We want to apply for another  5 years with this program.
