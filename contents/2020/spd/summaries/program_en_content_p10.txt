SOLIDARITY PROGRAM  FOR THE 2020 LOCAL  ELECTIONS11 Combat loneliness Loneliness  is an often suppressed  topic that we need to address  much more. Among  the older generation  in particular,  this has been accepted   in silence  for far too long. We will set up the first staff unit in Germany  to combat  loneliness,  which develop  new models  for Dortmund  to tackle  this  problem.  Nobody  should,  nobody  has to be lonely  in Dortmund  - that is our goal, because  there are real fates behind  this.
