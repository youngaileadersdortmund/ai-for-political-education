LIVING PROGRAM  FOR THE 2020 LOCAL  ELECTIONS4 Above  all, however,   will be crucial  to space available  more easily,  quickly  and cost-effectively.  A municipal  service  company  is to be founded  for this  purpose . Better  development of neighborhoods The development  of settlements  as a whole  will  of crucial  importance  for urban development  in the future.  This is characterized  by the fact  that, as in the past, continuous  spatial  growth  must be managed  again.  On the one hand, this initial situation  places  high demands  on urban  development  policy,  which must analyze  the opportunities  and risks of districts  and settlements  and develop  proposals  for solutions.  On the  other hand, it must not lose sight of the development  of the city as a whole.  Our aim is to achieve  a good mix in the city that brings  people   together.  Through  "master  planning  for housing"  for the entire city, we want to provide  targeted  incentives  to create  neighborhoods  for families,   young  singles  and couples  as well as households  between  family  and retirement  throughout  the city. Speculation  - not possible with us We want to prevent  speculation  with land. The sale of municipal  land to private  housing  investors  should   largely  avoided.  The land should   allocated  either by means  of heritable  building  rights or by sale with a right of repurchase.  At the same time, we are striving  for a municipal  land supply   policy in order to curb the enormous  increases  in land prices.  The existing  plots should  offered  to the non-profit  cooperatives  and DOGEWO  at good  conditions.  When allocating  these municipal  plots, we will  in contracts  that only affordable  housing  is to be built.
