Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify key visual aspects of Dortmund that would change based on the election program of the Free Democrats. They need a list of comma-separated visual elements without any extra info.

First, I need to go through the provided election program summary and pick out the parts that relate to physical changes in the city's appearance. Let me scan through the text again.

The program mentions digitalization and AI, which might not be visual but could relate to tech infrastructure. Then there's talk about start-up centers and supporting young companies. Maybe that leads to more modern buildings or co-working spaces. 

They mention expanding the cycle path network and making Dortmund a "bicycle city." So more bike lanes and maybe bike-friendly infrastructure. Also, the light rail system improvements could mean better stations or more tracks, affecting the city's look.

Greening of roofs and façades, using roof areas for renewables, and urban gardening options. These are definitely visual changes—more green spaces, solar panels on buildings, rooftop gardens. 

The part about making the city more accessible for seniors and people with disabilities might involve more ramps, tactile paving, or other infrastructure changes. 

Digital services and citizen apps could lead to more digital kiosks or signage. Also, the mention of reducing the number of city-managed properties and selling unused ones might lead to new developments or changes in building use.

The dog tax abolition might not directly affect visuals, but maybe more parks or pet-friendly areas. 

Public transport improvements like modernizing stops with green areas and sponsoring partnerships could mean more aesthetically pleasing bus stops with greenery and ads. 

Reducing traffic congestion and modernizing traffic systems might involve new traffic lights, signage, or road layouts. 

The education aspects like digital classrooms and talent schools could mean more tech-equipped schools, which might have a different architectural style or more tech installations. 

Also, the focus on diversity and inclusion might lead to more public art or cultural installations celebrating diversity. 

I need to make sure I'm only listing visual aspects. Let me check each point again. For example, "greening of roofs and façades" is visual. "Expanded cycle path network" is visual. "Digital janitors" might refer to tech, but not sure. "Smartboard updates" in schools are tech, but maybe the classrooms look different. 

Wait, the user wants only visual changes. So things like more bike lanes, green roofs, solar panels, improved public transport stations, better lighting, maybe more public art, accessible infrastructure, digital kiosks, etc. 

I should avoid non-visual aspects like policies or services. So the final list should be specific visual elements. Let me compile them now.
