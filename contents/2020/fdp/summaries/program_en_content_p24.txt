Efficient management of the airport The airport has positive effects for the business location and the mobility of Dortmund residents. At the  same time, many people in Dortmund and Unna are affected by aircraft noise. In this consideration, we  advocate the preservation of the airport within the framework of the current infrastructure. However,  permanent subsidies at the expense of the city and the municipal utilities are unacceptable. The airport  company must at least achieve a balanced operating result. The necessary adjustments to operating times  and runway utilization have been made. Before the corona crisis, the economic outlook for the airport  was positive for the first time in a long time, but the management must avoid the looming dependence on  a dominant airline by diversifying. We want to work towards this on the airport's Supervisory Board. Further improving long-distance train connections Fast and frequent long-distance train connections are the key to business travel to and from Dortmund.  Dortmund's local politicians must make a strong case to Deutsche Bahn for the urgent expansion of the  Dortmund-MÃ¼nster bottleneck line in order to speed up traffic to Hamburg. Reduce traffic noise Traffic noise is one of the biggest environmental burdens in large cities. Dortmund has not given this issue  sufficient priority. This is evident from the fact that the Noise Advisory Council has rarely met. We Free  Democrats want to change this. The use of noise-reducing asphalt, better traffic light control to avoid loud  "stop and go", noise reduction in public transport and local and justified speed restrictions on particularly  polluted roads are elements of a consistent inner-city noise protection program. In contrast, we reject  comprehensive 30 km/h zones as disproportionate. With regard to noise from highways, railroads and air  traffic, a regular dialog with the responsible authorities and companies should be held on possible  improvements. Green right turn arrow Time spent in traffic jams is time lost. In order to improve the traffic situation in urban areas and take  individual traffic situations into account, we are calling for the green right turn arrow (traffic sign 720  "green arrow sign") to be used more frequently. Conflicts with bicycle traffic must be taken into account.
