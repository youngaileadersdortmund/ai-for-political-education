The expansion of the cycle path network should be based on actual demand. More  important to us than lighthouse projects in the city center are quality assurance and improvement of cycle  paths throughout the city. Many cycle paths are repeatedly interrupted, meander dangerously from the  footpath onto the road or are missing altogether. However, people will only cycle more often if there is a  safe cycling infrastructure. Safe cycling infrastructure gradually includes clear and separate traffic lights for cyclists. The only way to  prevent different road users from getting in each other's way is to have clearly visible and separate  signage for cycle paths and clear traffic routing. The current popularity of e-bikes requires the expansion of charging stations throughout the city to  ensure that citizens always have the opportunity to recharge their bikes. Finally, parking facilities for  bicycles in the city center need to be improved. Roads and sidewalks in good condition Regardless of whether you travel by car or bus, the city's roads must be in good condition. We focus on  maintaining the roadways within the existing infrastructure. The same applies to pavements, which must  be safe for all pedestrians. In the area of road expansion, we want to accelerate the construction of the  Nordspange in order to relieve the northern inner city in particular of traffic and emissions. Parking space management instead of parking displacement A traffic turnaround, especially for shopping traffic, is not possible without a reform of parking space  management and Park & Ride services. As long as hour-long parking for shopping in the city center is  cheaper than a public transport ticket, people from outside Dortmund in particular will not use Park &  Ride. At the same time, we reject attempts to artificially reduce the number of parking spaces without any  alternative for citizens. Specifically, we advocate an increase in parking fees within the Wallring - both on the streets and in the  parking garages. This should be progressive in terms of duration so that short-term parkers are not  affected. In return, parking fees in the suburban centers should be completely eliminated - also to  revitalize the secondary centers within the city. Zones close to the city center, such as Kaiserstrasse and  Saarlandstrasse, are to retain their current regulations. At the same time, parking space management is to  be introduced for the DSW Park&Ride parking lots - the parking ticket will then be valid as a ticket for up to 5 people in the city area. Infrastructure for alternative drives The traffic turnaround also includes individual transportation with alternative drive systems. We want to  ensure politically that sufficient charging and refueling facilities are available for both electromobility and  hydrogen cars. This is the task of the private sector, but local politics can act as a moderator here and also  ensure that the necessary conditions are created on public roads. Such a supply strategy is a contribution to not having to continue the policy of traffic restrictions. Driving  bans are not our way. If emissions from
