2 The Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025 of the CDU The Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025 of the CDU Dortmund describes our ideas for the future of our city.
In this regard, we see Dortmund as a city in which opportunities become reality, as a city that we can be proud of, as a city in which we can shape the future together.
Our convictions are based on around 1,200 years of city history, in which it has always been possible to win the future anew.
Whether it is the medieval trade history, the industrial history with coal, steel and beer or the largely successful structural change to a modern service and technology location in the 21st century.
The ever-present changes in the cityscape and the numerous renowned prizes for urban planning, sustainability, climate protection, digitisation and innovative administration are evidence of the successful transformations of the past decades.
We are firmly convinced that we will successfully master the challenges of the Corona pandemic and emerge stronger from this crisis.
In this regard, it is clear to us that the realisation of the future The discussions about the Dortmund “Tatort” show that the widespread cliché image of our city is not shared by the people of Dortmund.
Because the urban city of Dortmund has more to offer than just being one of the greenest cities in Europe with a 63 percent green area, a city with 10 percent nature and landscape conservation areas and one of the largest university locations in Germany with 54,000 students and excellence in research and teaching.
In our hometown, artificial intelligence, modern logistics, medicine and active substance research, future mobility and world market leaders from various industries are located.
In addition, there are many other outstanding highlights in the economic, social and cultural sector to discover.
We Dortmunders can achieve everything – and that at the highest level!
Future-oriented major projects of the recent past (such as the technology park, the Westfalenhütte area, Phoenix West, the Phoenix Lake, the city crown, Hohenbuschei or the concert hall) have brought Dortmund forward and created new perspectives.
With “Smart Rhino”, the future concept Westfalenhallen, the redesign of For example, at the European Football Championship 2024, the International Horticultural Exhibition (IGA 2027), or the Olympics 2032 in the Ruhr area.
Dortmund is a multicoloured, up-and-coming, courageous and open-minded city with committed and down-to-earth citizens who look to the future with confidence.
Dortmund is a modern and dynamic metropolis that is shaped by the participatory cooperation of the city society.
A strong point in Dortmund is our well-developed and diverse educational landscape.
Excellent work is done at our schools and universities.
Our primary goal is to bind the first-class trained young people to our city and to offer them prospects for the future here.
That is why we as the CDU will consistently look to the future, develop and implement future-oriented political offers.
We cordially invite you to join us and to take this path together with us!
The following guidelines characterise this path for us: • The social discourse must not be left to those who want a different city society.
• A triad of citizens, politics and administration should create an environment in which career, family and life in any way possible become possible in a region that values life and is modern.
• The protection of the climate and affordable energy for tenants, homeowners and businesses are two sides of the same coin.
• Industrial and commercial manufacturing form the basis of our prosperity.
The “Ruhr Conference” initiated by the current CDU-led state government deals with various forums on topics such as mobility, transport systems, education, security, health, environmental and landscape planning, energy transition, industry, digitalisation and tourism.
The goal: interlinked results should provide the compass for a positive development of our region.
The future of our city can only be designed and shaped here.
Funding programmes from Düsseldorf, Berlin and Brussels can help and support.
However, the necessary ideas can only develop their effect after an in-depth dialogue with citizens.
Because the integration of intelligence, expertise and creativity of the committed Dortmund citizens is the best basis for a sustainable and broadly supported accept CDU Dortmund 4 The Dortmund Programme 2020-2025 of the CDU will therefore demand, promote and energetically strengthen the expansion of qualified citizen participation.
The knowledge and results gained in this context form the basis of our political decisions.
Living together in our city with over 600,000 people is diverse, colourful, life-affirming and characterised by different life concepts.
Many of our families in Dortmund have a migration history.
That is why it is important and self-evident that we as a Dortmund city society are open, humane and life-affirming.
We want to promote appropriate language, diversity, respect and tolerance.
We want to create a new Dortmund “we feeling” through creativity, participation of the public and constructive dialogues.
At the same time, we will ensure that the values of our free, democratic, emancipated and Christian-oriented society as well as our cultural anchoring are tolerated and respected.
Because a harmonious coexistence in diversity only works through the setting and adherence to rules and respect for other life concepts.
We understand this as We want to lead by example in Dortmund when it comes to the resources for a good climate, clean air and environmentally friendly transportation – in short: life in the city of the future.
The appropriate suit for this consists of common sense, viable concepts and the necessary pace.
Our Dortmund should:  Enable technology, cooperation and innovation for environmental and climate protection.
 Bring participatory and self-initiative climate protection to fruition.
 Create a climate-neutral future with support from the EU, the Federal Government and the state.
In the Dortmund metropolitan region, we want to bring mobility and climate protection together.
We want to optimally interlink individual transport of any kind, public transport and innovative mobility offers.
In the past, we have already initiated attractive projects to rethink mobility.
We will continue to do so in the future with test tracks for autonomous driving and a bicycle network that lives up to its name.
What we do not want: the restriction of individual freedom and the implementation of ideologically driven politics!
We Dortmunders meet each other at various city and district festivals, in cultural venues, in parks, at Cityring concerts, at markets, in our sports facilities and at major city events, to celebrate and bring this “together” to life.
The fact that “together” shapes our Dortmund was shown in the handling of the refugee crisis and is currently shown in the forward-looking, clear and consistent line in the fight against the Corona pandemic.
Dortmund has already recognised the opportunities of the mega-topic of digitalisation in the past and has been awarded as the “most digital city”.
How right this focus was is shown by the radical changes in the world of work as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Just as the industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century changed our jobs and our living conditions fundamentally, so too does digitalisation.
The foundations have been laid to take this technological development as an opportunity.
The change opens up prospects for a good future, in which Dortmund will succeed as a dynamic location for the forward-looking middle class, the crafts and as a powerful technological production location, offers secure jobs with good future prospect As a city council, we are working together on the future of our educational landscape – with diverse, decentralised and low-threshold offers for everyone.
Every day, new requirements are formulated from different areas for a modern metropolis.
These must be sorted and implemented.
Solid public finances are the basis for this.
Far-sighted budgeting for the good of the city has always been in the DNA of the CDU and will also continue to shape our actions in the future.
Because:  The solid Dortmund finances make many projects possible.
 The investments are high, so that a considerable increase in the civic wealth is created.
 Dortmund needs a balancing budget policy that, on the one hand, enables the maintenance of social services, but also sets impulses for the maintenance of dynamic urban development.
These are our programme and our idea for a strong Dortmund, even in the future.
Our administration and the companies of the municipal group work very well.
They are the 360-degree service providers for all those who participate in the economic, cultural and social success of our city.
We want to carry this as a guiding principle into the new decade and live it.
In order to achieve this goal, a qualified and planned digitalisation of the city administration as well as innovative municipal companies are necessary.
This is particularly in the interest of the citizens.
The ongoing qualification of all employees must be guaranteed for this purpose.
Modern technologies have turned the administration and municipal companies into "all-round service providers" for us Dortmunders, who provide their service offerings regardless of weekdays and opening hours.
In this way, the citizens' service also keeps up with the digital age.
Uncomplicated accessibility and high citizen friendliness are important, because they promise an image gain for the administration, municipal companies and not least for the employees.
A success for the digital metropolis Dortmund!
Around 90 suburbs in twelve city districts form a metropolis: our Dortmund.
Our Dortmund is not alone.
We want to have a good neighbourhood with the surrounding communities.
As the centre of a dynamic region, we are looking for good, sustainable exchange with our regional partners.
As CDU, we are sending our strongest forces to the Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe (LWL), to the Ruhr Parliament (RVR), which is directly elected for the first time, to the assembly of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) and to various other regional committees.
Dortmund must and will be represented well and competently there – in terms of personnel and content!
Our Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025, our election programme, presents our goals in detail in three thematic blocks:  Where we are at home – living environments for Dortmund.
 600,000 heads – the Dortmund society.
 So that nothing is missing – public services for Dortmund.
We work for Dortmund, today and in the future!
We are getting to work for Dortmund, together with you!
We live: Dortmund.
Future.
Shape.
6 The Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025 of the CDU Where we are at home – living environments for Dortmund Housing, urban development and the environment – for a modern and sustainable life in our city Dortmund is the growing Westphalian central location and in future is to convey the character of a metropolis even more clearly.
In addition to the areas of trade, culture, universities, sport, trade fairs and congresses, this claim must be found even more strongly in urban development.
Housing, living and working must be brought together more strongly in Dortmund.
For this we want to become the city of short distances.
We want our city to create sufficient living space in all market segments so that the various housing needs are taken into account.
We want to consider housing, urban development and the environment as equally important in order to be future-proof as an urban and attractive large city.
We want to continue and further develop the previously successful path in Dortmund’s climate policy.
Our goal is the continuous reduction of greenhouse gas emissions up to “net zero” by 2050 – with the intermediate The criterion of social compatibility is just as decisive for the CDU as the economic orientation of Dortmund as the central location of the Ruhr area and the entire Westphalia.
7 The Dortmund Program 2020 – 2025 of the CDU Our political goals are:  Creation of sufficient housing supply in all market segments  Construction of 2,500 dwellings per year until 2025  Special housing program for young families with the goal of a total of 5,000 new dwellings until 2025  Increase in the ownership quota to 30 percent by 2025  Creation of ownership promotion for more rental housing on the market  More ownership promotion for more rental housing on the market  Active land reserve policy for the housing construction of the future  Prioritization of densification, expansion, attic conversion and conversion of previously used areas for new housing  Interventions in the free space only if there are no alternatives for the realization of housing potentials �� Every day, tens of thousands of workers commute to and from our city.
Mobility is still a basic prerequisite for participation and economic development.
However, our citizens also have a claim to an intact infrastructure, because it is their civic assets.
Against the background that mobility is changing in our society, the traffic areas and their use must be regularly reviewed and evaluated.
We want to enable our citizens to use the respective areas individually in the future.
We want to design new traffic area divisions in such a way that both pedestrians and cyclists and drivers benefit from them.
In addition, we want to expand public transport within the scope of the possibilities so that it is used even more.
Our aim is for Dortmund to remain attractive as a central location for trade and culture in the future.
We want to connect living and working more closely on site, in order to achieve traffic relief where possible.
However, we will regularly advocate for avoiding economic damage and job losses in our city.
For commuters, for example, significantly improved regional transport concepts must be developed, Park+Ride systems must be expanded inter-communally, cycle networks must be optimized and the public transport/regional transport network must be further developed.
We are also committed to establishing modern digital traffic management systems at the municipal and regional level in order to achieve further progress in terms of reducing environmental impact.
We are committed to continuing to pursue the maintenance and repair of transport surfaces as a central political goal.
We are also committed to taking ecological issues into account.
We want to give citizens the freedom they need for their individual mobility needs.
We are committed to this on the basis of conviction and voluntary action.
We reject the idea of massively restricting the mobility of individual groups for ideological reasons.
12 The Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025 of the CDU Our political goals are:  Strengthening public transport in Dortmund through better offers and higher performance in the existing system  Light rail and bus concept as the basis for further expansion scenarios for public transport, taking into account various drive technologies  Decision for the expansion of public transport  Better separation and better protection of pedestrian areas  Mixed use only in case of no alternative to motorized traffic  Traffic planning that treats all road users equally and plans traffic areas in their entirety – not one-sidedly to the advantage or detriment of individual modes of transport  Development of alternative drive systems such as hydrogen, fuel cells or e-mobility, along with the construction of a corresponding infrastructure network  Efficient use of traffic areas through intelligent traffic control measures (telematics) with a different number of lanes depending on need  Test track for autonomous driving  Optimization of the traffic lights towards a “green wave” for a speed limit of 50  Dortmund as “city of roundabouts”  Review of the underground tunnel of the B1 and development of possible alternative design concepts  Removal of the traffic lights at the intersection of B1/Semerteichstraße for better traffic flow 15 The Dortmund Program 2020 – 2025 of the CDU � The clubs and communities of amateur sports play a central role here.
We will continue to support our clubs and the many volunteers to the best of our ability.
In addition, we want to secure the future of our parks and leisure facilities.
In order to make the facilities future-proof and attractive and thus enrich urban life, we need to develop comprehensive usage concepts.
18 The Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025 of the CDU Our political goals are:  Support for major sporting events (Football EM 2024, Olympics 2032, etc.) to improve the image and sporting infrastructure of our city  Further strengthening and support of the NRW Sports School Goethe Gymnasium Dortmund and the Dortmund Sports Internat through a long-term concept and a reliable budget  Promotion of top-level sport through more intensive networking and coordination of existing facilities and organizations, involving the TU Dortmund  Further renovation and refurbishment of sports facilities and the associated infrastructure, for example changing rooms in line with energy standards  Retention of existing and creation The university city of Dortmund is growing.
As a cultural center of an entire region, the city has a special role and responsibility.
We want to consolidate and further develop the high quality and variety of cultural offerings in Dortmund.
This includes, above all, the profile as the “City of Music” that is perceived locally, regionally and beyond.
Throughout the Ruhr region, Dortmund is considered the center of culture and the creative economy as well as high-quality artistic and musical offers for children and young people.
In addition, the CDU Dortmund is particularly committed to the quality and ambition-oriented, engaged promotion of the variety of free culture.
21 The Dortmund Program 2020 – 2025 of the CDU The Brüderstraße district, the creative Unionviertel with the expanded profile of the “Dortmunder U” as well as the now completed and renovated “Bühneviertel” on Hiltropwall and Kuhstraße are to become culturally shaped city districts.
As model examples for the impulse effect of cultural investments, cultural profiling and urban development of a large city in transition, these districts Culture is important to us: opera, operetta, ballet, drama, museums, libraries, adult education centres, folk high schools, and small-scale art, comedy, vernissages, folklore, club culture, celebration culture and subculture are all part of it.
Culture shapes the way we live in our districts and throughout the city.
Culture provides relaxation, inspiration, creativity, variety, tradition, and visitor and tourism magnets.
It makes life in Dortmund worth living.
Our political goals are: preservation of the variety and quality of culture in Dortmund and prevention of substance-threatening cutbacks, strengthening of regional networking and cooperation for the preservation of cultural sites, cultural and free culture need competition, which always requires proof of achievement, a master plan for culture as a compass for the future development of cultural institutions, actors and creative economy, creation of a museum development plan 2030, which outlines perspectives, priorities, content orientation, building requirements and opportunities for digital presentation formats, expansion of digital presence to attract new visitors and retain existing sympathisers at the respective venue, online presentation of permanent collections and special Security, order and cleanliness are the heart of the CDU Dortmund's policy.
In order for these goals to be achieved, clear rules are necessary, as well as a capable and well-organized administration that enforces the applicable law and ensures security, order and cleanliness.
This requires, on the one hand, adequate equipment of the administrative department of order and, on the other hand, good cooperation with other authorities, companies and citizens.
The order policy in Dortmund must take care of the concerns, fears, needs, wishes and suggestions of its citizens and respond to them.
A clean cityscape and a stringent order policy contribute to a better image of our city.
A zero tolerance strategy against criminal clans, political extremism and so-called tumultuous offenses helps, in our opinion, to achieve these goals.
26 The Dortmund Program 2020 – 2025 of the CDU Our political goals are:  Evaluation of data to determine "fear spaces" and "criminal hotspots" as a prerequisite for their systematic elimination and elimination  Staffing of all open positions Self-help is a guiding principle of our social policy.
The creation of jobs, good education and training, better qualifications, placement and the reintegration of long-term unemployed into the job market are just as important as the equality of women and the reconciliation of family and career.
In addition, areas such as housing construction, improved housing benefit or the promotion of home ownership.
Our excellent health system is also of fundamental importance, as was impressively demonstrated in the Corona crisis.
Senior citizens, people with disabilities and children and young people deserve special attention.
Social policy is a broad field and social policy references almost all topics in the present municipal election program.
The guarantee of social participation and the commitment to more social justice are the overriding goals of the CDU Dortmund.
Social policy is therefore a cross-sectional task.
Families and family support are essential focal points of our policy.
Social policy framework conditions are often set by the federal government and the state.
The scope for design at the municipal level is therefore sometimes limited and often restricted to executive tasks.
The good news: we are using the available scope to set strong social policy accents in Dortmund.
Our political goals are:  Retention, expansion and improved advertising of discounts for public services (admission fees, courses, etc.) 29 The Dortmund Programme 2020-2025 of the CDU  Adequate and up-to-date range of accommodation options for homeless people  Permanent establishment of a “hygiene house” for homeless people at Leuthardstraße 1-7  Expansion of street social work  Establishment of a mentor programme for voluntary work under the umbrella of the voluntary agency  Introduction of a “Dortmund social directory” with all information on offers and contact persons in the social sector as an open data platform and app  Strengthening of training in “part-time” to qualify single parents  Introduction of a voucher system for “women’s In view of the already noticeable shortage of skilled workers, this is all the more true.
With the EU's eastward expansion, there has been an increased influx of EU citizens, particularly from South-Eastern Europe.
In many cases, this is poverty migration, which poses major challenges for our city.
On the one hand, this involves measures to help the migrants - from health care and initial reception to language courses and integration projects.
On the other hand, the city must organise the fight against people smuggling, exploitation structures, extortionate rents, wage dumping, black work and other accompanying phenomena such as prostitution, crime or overcrowded accommodation in dilapidated buildings.
The enormous willingness of the people of Dortmund to help at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 moved us deeply.
Politically, we have positively supported the aid measures on the part of the city and made our contribution to this enormous effort.
Many people who fled war and persecution and came to Dortmund at that time still live in our city today.
The integration of many refugees into schools, training, professions and the Dortmund has made an extraordinary contribution nationwide, often up to the limits of its capacity.
30 The Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025 of the CDU In Europe and at the European borders, tens of thousands of refugees still live in large camps under inhumane conditions.
This makes it clear that only a pan-European solution can alleviate this situation.
The overloading of individual states in accepting refugees is not a viable solution and must not become the norm.
The reception of refugees in Europe must be resolved in a coordinated and solidary manner.
Only a targeted and accepted distribution of refugees by all European states guarantees that the enormous challenges in the member states can be overcome.
Only in this way can the broad willingness to help and acceptance be maintained.
Our political goals are:  Consistent fight against people smuggling  Continuation and support of the established task force from various administrations, which is dedicated to combating the criminality associated with people smuggling  Municipal pre-emption right for problem properties  Renovation of problem properties with the help of municipal companies This foreseeable development presents politics with new tasks and challenges, because we want to enable our senior citizens to participate in social life independently until old age.
This is our obligation, which we as CDU Dortmund are happy to fulfill.
As everywhere, the senior citizens in Dortmund are not a homogeneous group, but have different needs.
We will take these needs into account.
We want to make a self-determined life in the private sphere of Dortmund's senior citizens possible to the highest possible extent.
Our political goals are: The future of our society is decisively shaped by the family.
To promote and support families, children and young people as best as possible is therefore one of our central tasks.
We want to make the reconciliation of family and career easier through better childcare that places the well-being of the child at the forefront.
We want to create an attractive living and residential environment for all children and young people, and make Dortmund the first choice for families when they make the decision about their future place of residence.
However, we always keep in mind those people whose family structures have been disrupted or lost, as well as those citizens who consciously choose alternative lifestyles.
The protection of children and young people is always our top priority.
Our political goals are:  Construction of 2,500 dwellings per year until 2025  Special housing program for young families with the goal of a total of 5,000 new dwellings by 2025  Increase of the equity quota to 30 percent by 2025  Creation of ownership models in municipal housing companies for the promotion We are not conducting a debate about school structures, but rather want to improve the quality of education.
For this reason, we treat all school types equally.
We reject ideologically motivated preferential treatment of individual school types.
The social background of children must not determine their educational success.
For us, the well-being of children with and without disabilities is of paramount importance.
The education of our children is the key to social advancement, protection against unemployment and the greatest possible participation in our society.
We want the infrastructure of our educational institutions to provide a healthy and motivating environment in which children enjoy learning and teachers enjoy teaching.
The development of media competence is another central issue.
The same applies to the cultural education of our children.
To avoid repetition, we refer to our ideas and plans in this regard in the chapter “Culture – Children – Youth Culture”.
Our political goals are:  Continuation of school development planning  Support for the implementation of the school construction program for innovative, modern schools  Collection and processing of data on school construction measures for more transparency for schools and parents  Ideologically neutral preservation of all existing school types including special schools  Construction of two grammar schools to avoid too large schools  No expansion or construction of new comprehensive schools at the expense of primary or secondary schools  Support for the establishment of further talent schools by the state  Support for the compulsory expansion of the open-door comprehensive school (OGS) with corresponding further development  Definition of a common registration date for all schools – early registration for comprehensive schools impairs free school choice  Schools close to home, if necessary also through agreements with neighboring cities  Increased safety on the way to school through the introduction of the concept of “yellow feet” and expansion of the concept of “So läuft das”  Ideas workshop for more safety on the way to school  Just as an attractive municipal tax policy.
The technological change caused by digitalization and the introduction of new operating and production processes must go hand in hand with the establishment of craft businesses, so that living and working in one location is possible again.
We also want to further strengthen the university location with around 54,000 students, because science and research have long been an essential part of the success in dealing with structural change.
An attractive climate for companies and employees also helps to counteract the shortage of skilled workers.
36 The Dortmund Program 2020 – 2025 of the CDU Our political goals are: Spatial policy  Revitalization of old and vacant land before free space use, even with delayed profitability  Transparent and strict inventory of land potential  Land acquisition and development in the hands of economic development  Improvement of spatial policy through a new “Special Fund for Economic Land” together with the provision of appropriate financial resources for the acquisition, development and marketing of their own land  Time-saving approvals and implementations as so-called “One-Stop-Shop solutions”  When allocating land, the focus is Our political goals are:  Contain the further growth of chain stores and promote attractive individual trade more strongly  Targeted promotion of small-scale specialist retail in the secondary centres of  Strengthening a lively gastronomy scene in the city  Development of the Union district in the Rheinische Straße area with the existing pub and gastronomy scene into a popular nightlife district  Development of a modern concept for attractive Dortmund weekly markets  No construction of a market hall on Hansaplatz Healthcare/Clinic/Nursing 4.0 The politically active renovation of the Dortmund Clinic has so far taken a successful path.
As a hospital providing maximum care, the clinic is of great importance for the entire region and can be sure of our greatest possible support, just like all other hospitals in our city.
The healthcare industry is of enormous importance for Dortmund today.
According to its own statements, around 85,000 employees work in the district of the Dortmund Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
This makes the healthcare industry the largest employer in 40 The Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025 of the CDU In particular in the areas of care and support, great challenges will come to the city of Dortmund in the coming years.
We want to give political answers and find the best solutions.
Our political goals are: 

Strengthening of the Dortmund Clinic as a maximum care facility in municipal ownership
Support for the establishment of the largest nursing school in North Rhine-Westphalia on the Canisius Campus in Hoeschpark
Intensified promotion of company locations that produce age-appropriate assistance systems (AAL) or offer corresponding services
Employment/Employment
Although the unemployment rate is high compared to the national average, the situation on the labour market has developed positively in recent years.
We want to continue this trend, even if the current crisis brings new challenges to Dortmund.
The economic structure of the city with many small and medium-sized companies (KMU), which contribute significantly to the successes on the municipal labour market, offers good opportunities for coping with the consequences of the corona crisis.
Our political goals are: The sustainably successful financial policy of the last few years with budget surpluses in 2018 and 2019 is an incentive and obligation for us.
We will also cherish the city's finances in the coming years.
Our political goals are:  Balanced budgets with annual surpluses and debt reduction  Commitment to financial support from the state and federal government to compensate for the burden of the corona pandemic  Solution of the old debt problem by the state and federal government 43 The Dortmund Program 2020-2025 of the CDU  Strict adherence to the principle of conexity  Full reimbursement of refugee and integration costs by the state and federal government  Further optimization of the acquisition of funding by the city with the goal of bringing more funding to Dortmund  Ongoing review of the provision of municipal services for their necessity and effectiveness  Avoidance of additional burdens for citizens and companies through the renunciation of tax and fee increases We are well equipped in terms of both personnel and resources for the dynamics of change, which we will continue to face in Dortmund.
More than once, we have already shown in Dortmund that we can successfully manage change, change of course, change of mindset and development.
This will also be the case in the future.
The CDU has stood for innovation in education, the economy, science and research for decades as the party of practical reason.
Our social compass is oriented towards social justice, which has the goal of promoting and demanding.
Our main tasks are to make social interaction in the districts of the city attractive, with affordable housing, modern daycare centres and schools, modern mobility and attractive infrastructure in trade and cultural facilities.
We want to bring work and living together again.
We want to preserve the valuable and the tried and tested, while at the same time thinking and acting in new ways where necessary and appropriate.
With many big and numerous smaller ideas, we want to continue to develop Dortmund with moderation and balance.
Our Dortmund vision: The people of Dortmund should live in a city that makes many things possible.
With an open attitude towards further ideas and projects.
We know that the development of our city is an ongoing process.
Our Dortmund Programme 2020 – 2025 aims to be far-sighted, innovative, moderate and balanced in presenting various options for living together in our city society and we are firmly committed to working together with you to implement our Dortmund Programme.
Out of love for our city – out of love for our homeland.
