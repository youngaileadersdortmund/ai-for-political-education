Okay, I need to figure out ten central "impact points" from the Dortmund Programme 2020-2025 of the CDU. The user wants specific local aspects that would be affected or changed if the program is implemented. Each impact point needs an identifier, description, importance weight (0-1), and reasoning. The final output should be a JSON list.

First, I'll read through the provided text carefully. The program mentions several areas: climate, digitalization, housing, urban development, social policy, education, healthcare, sports, culture, and security. Let me list possible points.

1. **Climate and Environment**: The CDU wants to lead in climate, clean air, and eco-friendly transport. This is a key point, so high importance. Identifier: "climate_environment_impact".

2. **Digitalization**: Dortmund is already the "most digital city." They mention modern tech in administration. Importance might be high. Identifier: "digitalization_advancement".

3. **Housing and Urban Development**: They want to integrate living and working, ensure sufficient housing. High importance. Identifier: "housing_urban_integration".

4. **Social Policy and Family Support**: Focus on family, childcare, education. Important. Identifier: "social_family_support".

5. **Education and School Policies**: No new comprehensive schools at the expense of others, common registration date. Important. Identifier: "education_school_reforms".

6. **Healthcare and Nursing**: Strengthening the clinic, nursing school. Important. Identifier: "healthcare_nursing_infrastructure".

7. **Cultural and Community Development**: Promoting culture, music, and community events. High importance. Identifier: "cultural_community_engagement".

8. **Security and Cleanliness**: Zero tolerance for crime, maintaining order. Important. Identifier: "security_cleanliness_priorities".

9. **Sports and Leisure Facilities**: Supporting clubs and parks. Important. Identifier: "sports_leisure_facilities".

10. **Economic Development and Innovation**: AAL (Assistive Living) technologies, company locations. Important. Identifier: "economic_innovation_growth".

Now, check if these cover the main points. The text also mentions refugee integration, but maybe that's part of social policy. Also, the part about not building a market hall on Hansaplatz is specific but maybe not a central impact point. The user asked for ten, so I'll stick with these.

For importance weights: Climate, digitalization, housing, social policy, education, healthcare, culture, security, sports, and economy. Most of these are discussed in detail, so weights around 0.8-1.0. Maybe some are slightly lower if the discussion is less detailed.

Now, write the JSON with identifiers, descriptions, importance, and reasoning. Make sure no quotes in the descriptions and reasoning. Use proper JSON syntax. Check for any errors.
