Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to identify key visual aspects of Dortmund that would change based on the CDU's election program. They need a list of comma-separated visual elements without any extra info.

First, I need to go through the provided program summary and pick out the parts that mention changes to the city's appearance. Let me scan through each section.

The program mentions "green belt" or "green axis" from north to south, increasing greenery to 63%, and 10% nature conservation areas. So, more green spaces, parks, green belts, maybe more trees. Also, green roofs on public transport shelters. That's visual.

Then there's the "Smart Rhino" project on the former HSP site and creating new residential areas with architecturally valuable "Townhouses." So new buildings, maybe modern architecture, townhouses. Also, revitalization of parks like Rombergpark and zoo, development of Westfalenpark. So improved parks, renovated areas.

Transportation changes: expanding cycling paths, bicycle parking garages, better pedestrian paths, barrier-free sidewalks, traffic circles, autonomous driving test tracks. Visual aspects here would be new bike lanes, parking structures, pedestrian zones, traffic circles, maybe more bike racks.

Public transport improvements: H-Bahn expansion, cable cars, better public transport infrastructure. So new transit systems, maybe cable cars, upgraded stations.

Digital infrastructure: 5G networks, free Wi-Fi, digital road condition register. Not sure if that's visual, but maybe more digital signage or infrastructure.

Urban development projects like the port development on Speicherstrasse, campus for digital and start-ups. So new buildings, tech campuses, maybe modern office spaces.

Renovations of cultural areas: Brückstraßenviertel, UnionviERTel, Dortmund U, BühnenVIertel. So renovated buildings, cultural districts, maybe new theaters or venues.

Safety and cleanliness: more lighting, litter bins, SOS app. Visual aspects could be better lighting, more trash cans, maybe more surveillance cameras.

Housing: 2,500 apartments per year, new residential areas, townhouses. So new housing developments, modern residential buildings.

Environmental initiatives: water features in city design, more green roofs, reducing CO2 emissions. So maybe more water elements like fountains or canals, green roofs on buildings.

Cultural promotions: Choir Academy, expanded cultural events, festivals. Maybe more public art, event spaces, festivals leading to temporary installations.

I need to make sure I'm only listing visual changes. Avoid things like policies or programs unless they directly affect the city's look. For example, "green belt" is visual, "digital infrastructure" might not be unless it's physical like signage. But the user might expect things like more green spaces, new buildings, cycling infrastructure, improved parks, etc.

Let me compile the list:

- More green spaces, parks, green belts
- Green roofs on public transport shelters
- New residential areas with townhouses
- Revitalized parks (Rombergpark, Westfalenpark)
- Expanded cycling paths and bike parking
- Improved pedestrian pathways and traffic circles
- Modern public transport infrastructure (H-Bahn, cable cars)
- Cultural district renovations (Brückstraßenviertel, Dortmund U)
- Enhanced lighting and safety features
- New urban development projects (Smart Rhino, port area)
- Increased water features in city design
- Barrier-free sidewalks and pedestrian zones
- Digital signage and infrastructure (Wi-Fi, 5G)
- Updated housing developments and apartment complexes
- More public art and cultural installations
- Improved street furniture (litter bins, SOS app features)

Wait, some of these might be stretching. The user wants only visual aspects. "Digital signage" is visual. "SOS app features" might not be visual. Maybe focus on physical changes. Let me refine:

- Green belts and increased greenery
- More parks and recreational areas
- New residential townhouses
- Revitalized cultural districts
- Expanded cycling infrastructure (paths, parking)
- Improved pedestrian zones and sidewalks
- Modern public transport systems (cable cars, H-Bahn)
- Green roofs on buildings
- Water features in urban design
- Enhanced street lighting
- New urban development projects (Smart Rhino, port)
- Cultural venues and event spaces
- Barrier-free urban design elements
- Increased public art and installations
- Upgraded housing developments

I think that's a solid list. Now, format it as comma-separated without any extra text.
