41The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU Dortmund 4.0 - ready for the digital future Digitalization is one of the megatopics of the coming years. For us as the CDU, the intact digital  infrastructure as well as the digital provision of municipal services is a major locational advantage for  Dortmund. It also shows that our city is one of the leaders in Germany when it comes to  digitalization. Our political goals are: •Increasing the level of digitalization of Dortmund's city administration to one of the best in  Germany by 2025 •Expansion of responsibilities and redesignation of the Council Committee for Personnel  and Organization as the "Committee for Digital, Personnel and Organization" •Digital availability of almost all municipal services by 2025 and reducing the need for  visits to authorities as much as possible •Evaluation of the "Digital building application" pilot project of the state of North Rhine- Westphalia with the aim of improving efficiency in building permit procedures •Achieving a "digitalization dividend" in the course of the digitalization of  administrative processes, which in turn increases the deployment of  municipal employees to elsewhere in the administration - the aim is to increase the efficiency of the administration •Data protection and data security are non-negotiable •Utilizing the opportunities of open data in municipal administration
