6The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU  Where we are at home - living environments for  D o r t m u n d   Housing, urban development and the environment - for  modern and sustainable living in our city Dortmund is the growing Westphalian regional center and should convey the character of a  metropolis even more clearly in the future. In addition to the areas of trade, culture, universities,  sport, trade fairs and congresses, this claim must be reflected even more strongly in urban  development. Housing, living and working must be brought closer together again in Dortmund. To achieve this, we  must become the city of short distances. We want our city to create sufficient living space in all market segments to meet the various housing  needs. We would therefore like to consider housing, urban development and the environment as  equally as possible in order to be fit for the future as an urban and attractive city. We want to continue and further develop Dortmund's successful climate policy. Our goal is to  continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the "Zero emissions" in 2050 - with the interim targets of a 55% reduction by 2030 and a 70% reduction  by 2040. It is important to us to take into account the concerns of climate protection to the same  extent as environmental and nature conservation, social security for citizens and the performance of  the business location. The criterion of social compatibility is just as decisive for the CDU as the  economic orientation of Dortmund as the main center of the Ruhr region and the whole of  Westphalia.
