21The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU The Brückstraßenviertel, the creative Unionviertel with the expanded profile of the "Dortmunder U"  and the now completed and renovated "Bühnenviertel" on Hiltropwall and Kuhstraße are to become  culturally characterized urban districts. As prime examples of the impulse effect of cultural  investment, cultural profiling and urban development in a major city in transition, these districts are  attracting regional and national attention. For the CDU as a people's party, cultural policy is not elitist advocacy for the few. Cultural offerings  must be available and affordable in all parts of Dortmund. For us, culture means opera, operetta,  ballet, drama, museums, libraries, adult education centers and music schools. For us, it also includes  cabaret, comedy, vernissages, the preservation of customs, club culture, party culture and  subculture. Culture shapes the way we live together in our districts and the city as a whole. Culture is  relaxation, inspiration, creativity, variety, the cultivation of tradition, visitor and tourism magnet. It  makes life in Dortmund worth living. Our political goals are: •Preserving the diversity and quality of culture in Dortmund and  preventing savings that could jeopardize its substance •Strengthening regional networks and cooperation for the preservation of cultural sites •Urban and independent culture need competition, which always bases the right to  funding on proof of performance •"Masterplan Culture" as a compass for the future development of cultural  institutions, stakeholders, cultural and creative industries •Creation of a "Museum Development Plan 2030" that outlines perspectives, priorities,  content orientation, structural requirements and opportunities for digital presentation  formats •Expansion of the digital presence to attract new visitors and retain existing supporters of the  respective house •Online presentation of collections and individual exhibitions from museums and other  cultural institutions •Cultural and creative industries as a growing component of Dortmund's economy and society  - Preservation of established facilities in the alternative club, music, art, gastronomy and  theater scenes •Promoting acceptance of club culture as well as exchange and balance with local residents •Revitalization of former entertainment and restaurant districts •Appointment of a competent and well-connected Dortmund-based "Night mayor" or club manager or event coordinator •Review of the legal form of existing municipal cultural institutions to strengthen their own  responsibility - promotion of more independence, more scope for action and more  responsibility for results •Further development of Dortmund as a "city of music" •Consistent and sustainable urban development of the Brückstraßenviertel into a  creative and music district
