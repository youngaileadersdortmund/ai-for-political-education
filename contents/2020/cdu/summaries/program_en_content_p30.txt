31The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU Senior citizens Senior citizens are a valuable and enriching part of our urban society. Against the backdrop of  demographic change, the group of senior citizens in Dortmund will continue to grow. This  foreseeable development presents politicians with new tasks and challenges, as we want to enable  our senior citizens to participate in social life in a self-determined way into old age. This is our  obligation, which we as the CDU Dortmund are happy to fulfill. As everywhere, senior citizens in  Dortmund are of course not a homogeneous group, but have different needs. We will take these  needs into account. Our aim is to enable Dortmund's senior citizens to lead a highly self-determined life in their own  private environment. Our political goals are: •Review of all existing senior citizen work facilities with the aim of redesigning  them to improve the quality of services in all city districts •Development of new concepts to combat loneliness among senior citizens, taking into  account experiences during the coronavirus pandemic •Transferring and processing the results and experiences and integrating them into an  overall concept that addresses loneliness and social isolation as a cross-cutting issue  affecting all age groups •Central contact person or coordinator in the city administration to set up and manage  existing services for senior citizens •Strengthening the staffing of the senior citizens' offices in the districts •Creation of initially four digital support points for senior citizens in the city districts with  a comprehensive range of advice and support services •Introduction of a "senior citizens' app" to offer senior citizens easier access to topics such as  care, support, prevention, etc. •Expansion of housing offers in multi-generational houses as an example of "intergenerational  housing" with social benefits for young and old people •Pilot projects for senior citizens to enable them to participate in economic life and  continue working if they so wish •Business start-up program for older people •Orientation of urban planning towards barrier-free and senior-friendly living •Support for the Park Academy in Westfalenpark •Realization of a "dementia village"
