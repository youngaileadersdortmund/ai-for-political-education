17The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU Where activity is fun - sport and leisure in Dortmund Many Dortmund residents are sports enthusiasts and actively participate in a wide variety of sports.  The sports city of Dortmund offers a wide range of activities and a diverse sports infrastructure. Sport  promotes health, is integrative and strengthens togetherness. For many citizens, a positive work-life  balance is part of a modern lifestyle. Just as important for Dortmund are leisure facilities such as the  Revierpark, Rombergpark or Westfalenpark and public gardens such as those in the Mengede district.  They are important recreational areas and tourist destinations for visitors from near and far. We therefore support the sports and leisure facilities and the many active sportspeople, regardless  of whether they are organized in a club or keep fit individually. We want to strengthen and  encourage children and young people in their natural urge to exercise. We want to give senior  citizens space and opportunities for sporting activities. In addition to points, goals and  championships, we also want to strengthen the intergenerational, social function of sport. The clubs  and grassroots sports communities play a central role in this. We will continue to support our clubs  and the many volunteers to the best of our ability. We also want to secure a future for our parks and  leisure facilities. In order to make the facilities future-proof and attractive and thus enrich city life,  comprehensive utilization concepts need to be developed.
