30The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU In Europe and at the European borders, tens of thousands of refugees are still living in large camps  under inhumane conditions. This makes it clear that only a pan-European solution can ease this  situation. Overburdening individual countries with the reception of refugees is not expedient and  must not become the rule. The reception of refugees in Europe must be resolved in a spirit of  solidarity and coordination. Only a targeted distribution of refugees that is accepted by all European  states guarantees that the enormous challenges on the ground in the member states can be  overcome. This is the only way to maintain a broad willingness to help and acceptance. Our political goals are: •Consistently combating trafficking in human beings •Continuation and support of the task force set up by various administrations to combat the  crime associated with trafficking in human beings •Municipal right of first refusal for problem properties •Renovation of problem properties with the help of municipal companies •Transfer of these properties to new and neighborhood-friendly uses •Continuation of the federal government's "Socially Integrative City" program •Stronger commitment by the EU and the German government to work towards improving  living conditions in the countries of origin in order to prevent poverty-related migration
