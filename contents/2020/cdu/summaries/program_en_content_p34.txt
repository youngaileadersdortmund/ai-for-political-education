35The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU Dortmund workbench 4.0 In recent years, Dortmund has developed into an economically prosperous metropolis in NRW. This  has been achieved in particular thanks to the active economic policy of Dortmund's CDU. We want to  create framework conditions for business, research and science that will enable Dortmund to  continue its powerful and sustainable development after the current crisis. The existing structure of  Dortmund's economy as a "millipede" provides a strong basis for this. Only with a successful  Dortmund economy that generates prosperity can social issues be better resolved. It is of great importance to us that ecological and economic interests are considered together and  not against each other. Urban development and urban planning is the twin of economic  development. This is the only way we can make our city fit for the future - for a high quality of life  and for economic strength. That is why housing construction, schools, daycare centers, leisure  facilities, culture and an intact infrastructure are also important building blocks for a successful  economic policy. Just like an attractive municipal tax policy. Technological change, caused by digitalization and the introduction of new operating and  manufacturing processes, must once again go hand in hand with the establishment of craft  businesses so that living and working in one location is once again possible. We also want to further strengthen the university location with around 54,000 students, as science  and research have long been an essential part of the success in coping with structural change. An attractive climate for companies and employees also helps to counter the shortage of skilled  workers.So that nothing is missing - public  services for Dortmund
