25The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU    600,000 heads - the Dortmund company    Dortmund - safe.clean.liveable. For many citizens, living in a safe, clean and well-kept environment is a fundamental prerequisite for  their personal well-being. The city of Dortmund also benefits from cleanliness and safety in view of  the strong increase in tourism. The condition of the cityscape has an influence on the subjective  feeling of safety, as does the presence of law enforcement officers and the police. Safety, order and  cleanliness are at the heart of the CDU Dortmund's policy. Achieving these goals requires not only clear rules but also an energetic and well-organized  administration that enforces the law and ensures safety, order and cleanliness. This requires, on the  one hand, adequate resources for the public order administration and, on the other hand, good  cooperation with other authorities, businesses and citizens. Public order policy in Dortmund must  address the concerns, fears, needs, wishes and suggestions of its citizens and respond to them. A  clean cityscape and a stringent regulatory policy contribute to a better image of our city. In our view,  a zero-tolerance strategy against criminal clans, political extremism and so-called rioting offenses  helps to achieve these goals.
