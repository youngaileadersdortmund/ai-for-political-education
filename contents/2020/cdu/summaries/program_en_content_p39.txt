40The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU The city of Dortmund will face major challenges in the coming years, particularly in the areas of  nursing and care. We want to provide political answers and find the best solutions. Our political goals are: •Strengthening Dortmund Hospital as a maximum care facility under municipal  ownership •Support for the establishment of the largest nursing school in NRW on the "Canisius  Campus" at Hoeschpark •Intensified promotion of the establishment of companies that produce age- appropriate assisted living (AAL) systems or offer corresponding services Work/Employment Even though the unemployment rate is high compared to the national average, the situation on the  labor market has developed positively in recent years. We want to continue this trend, even if  Dortmund is facing new challenges as a result of the current crisis. The city's economic structure with many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which act as "millipedes" contribute significantly to the successes on the municipal labor market, offers good  conditions for overcoming the consequences of the corona crisis. Our political goals are: •Creating an attractive climate for companies and employees to tackle the shortage of skilled  workers •Further improving the compatibility of family and career •Leveraging and promoting the experience of digitalization during the coronavirus crisis  as a basis for new working time models •Pilot projects for "24-hour, 7-day open daycare centers" to improve work-life balance for  employees working shifts •Campaign for more company kindergartens •Retention of university graduates in Dortmund before graduation •Promoting and demanding as maxims of labor market policy - no abolition of  sanctions •Critical monitoring of municipal labor market promotion - prevention of  competition-distorting competition with the private sector •Rejection of a permanently subsidized public labor market •Promoting shared value creation: Engineering in Dortmund - Production in  South Westphalia
