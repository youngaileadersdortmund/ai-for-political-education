20The Dortmund Program 2020 - 2025 of the  CDU Quality of life - Dortmund as a city of culture The quality of life, attractiveness and experience value of our city are also expressed in the diversity  and quality of its cultural offerings. Dortmund as a city of culture gives expression to this claim. Art and cultural life are elementary attraction, image and quality features of a city. In order for  Dortmund to continue to flourish as the metropolis of Westphalia and the Ruhr region, we will  continue to sharpen the cultural profile of our city in the future. Culture is an important location factor when it comes to attracting jobs in attractive companies and  competing for the best minds in business, science, research, teaching and development. We want  commuters to move to our city and university graduates to work and live in Dortmund after  completing their studies. The university city of Dortmund is growing. As the cultural center of an  entire region, the city has a special role and responsibility. We want to maintain and further develop  the high quality and diversity of cultural offerings in Dortmund. Above all, this includes its profile as a "city of music", which is recognized locally, regionally and  nationally. Throughout the Ruhr region, Dortmund is regarded as a center for the cultural and  creative industries as well as for sophisticated artistic and musical offerings for children and young  people. In addition, the CDU Dortmund is particularly committed to promoting the diversity of  independent culture with a focus on quality and standards.
