Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the election program summary from the Free Democrats in Dortmund and identify the five most important visual aspects that would be affected if their program comes into effect. They need concise descriptions, each focused on the resulting visual appearance, and the final answer as a comma-separated list of about 25 words.

First, I need to read through the entire program summary carefully. The key points mentioned are about streamlining bureaucracy, digitalization, supporting SMEs, municipal diplomacy, debt management, legal system, education, youth participation, gender equality, social services, urban development, public transport, and mobility.

Now, I need to think about which of these would have a visual impact. Let's go through each section:

1. **Digitalization of processes**: This might lead to more digital kiosks, online portals, or digital signage in offices. Visual aspect could be digital interfaces replacing traditional ones.

2. **Urban development and public spaces**: The mention of pedestrian zones, green spaces, and aesthetic urban furniture. So, more pedestrian-friendly areas, greenery, and improved public furniture.

3. **Public transport and traffic**: The focus on pedestrian priority, traffic light reviews, and parking. Visual changes might be more pedestrian zones, clearer signage, and possibly more bike lanes.

4. **City branding and image**: The new brand strategy and making Dortmund a pioneer in administration. This could involve updated city logos, signage, and public information displays.

5. **Support for SMEs and businesses**: Maybe more business-friendly infrastructure, like better signage for local businesses or digital directories.

Wait, but the user wants the most important visual aspects. Let me check the summary again. The part about "urban greening, aesthetic urban furniture, and arrangements for the summer" stands out. Also, the "pedestrian zones" and "traffic light switches in favor of pedestrians" would change the look of streets. The digitalization part might lead to more digital displays. The "city's brand strategy" would affect visual identity. Also, the "expansion of public transport" like Stadtbahn and H-Bahn connections could involve new infrastructure visuals.

So, compiling these: digital interfaces, pedestrian zones, urban greening, public transport infrastructure, and city branding. Let me check the word count. Each description needs to be concise. Let me make sure they are all about the visual aspects and not just the policies. For example, "pedestrian zones with improved signage and traffic light design" is visual. "Digital interfaces in public offices" is visual. "Urban greening and aesthetic furniture" is visual. "Public transport infrastructure expansion" includes new trams, stations. "City branding with updated signage and visual identity" is visual. That's five points. Now, check the word count. Each point is about 5-6 words. Total around 25 words. That should work.
