The Left is the party of social justice.
We are the party that fights for a good life for all!
The conditions for good local politics are more difficult than ever.
The black-red coalition has made it clear that they do not want to improve the financial situation of the municipalities.
We clearly stand against racism and right-wing hate - everywhere!
We fight for disadvantaged neighborhoods and for people in poverty, against discrimination and exclusion.
We stand for a housing policy that is oriented towards the needs of people and not the market.
Everyone has the right to be mobile.
We are committed to good public transport in Dortmund, which we want to make free in the long term.
More and more people are affected by housing poverty in Germany.
In Dortmund, rents have risen by more than 50% in the last ten years.
Affordable housing is becoming scarce, especially for families, single parents and people with low incomes.
The Left is clearly on the side of tenants.
We are fighting for: • the socialization of large housing corporations • a strong municipal housing stock • real co-determination for tenants.
In Dortmund, the proportion of homes owned by profit-oriented housing corporations is particularly high.
Unused or poorly managed living space should be returned to public ownership.
The city of Dortmund must also use the instrument of expropriation for this.
Large profit distributions to DSW21 mean that tenants indirectly subsidize Dortmund Airport.
The Left demands: no profit distribution at DOGEWO, more stock in DSG and DO Housing justice.
About half of the people in Dortmund are entitled to a housing entitlement certificate or housing benefit.
The proportion of income spent on rent is particularly high in Dortmund.
People with low incomes must be helped specifically at the local level.
Dortmund urgently needs the construction of new, permanently occupied and price-controlled rental apartments.
We demand that the social bonds in the future must not be allowed to expire, but must continue to exist.
With a vacancy rate of 1.3%, there are hardly any available apartments that people can move into.
We want to prevent this!
Through a forward-looking land policy, strategically important land can be secured early on.
The Left wants to make it possible for new construction projects to be 100% social housing.
We reject the myth that this leads to ghettoisation.
The crisis in the housing market cannot be solved by new construction alone.
The Left demands: An expansion of the quota for social housing construction.
No further construction of single-family homes.
The preference for cooper.
For this, municipal housing supervision must be better equipped financially and in terms of personnel.
In Dortmund alone, five homeless people died on the streets within three weeks in the winter of 2025.
The Left wants to effectively combat homelessness with the Housing First system.
People are to be placed in their own apartments and supported according to their individual needs.
The council has already decided on the introduction of Housing First by a joint motion from the Left, Greens and CDU with a majority.
All emergency overnight accommodation facilities must be accessible free of charge at all times.
Separate safe spaces must be created for homeless queer people.
Public facilities and furnishings must not be designed to drive homeless people away or make their stay unattractive.
Die Linke in Dortmund is calling for the future abandonment of so-called defensive architecture.
DEW21 has managed to develop a concept for a CO2-free district heating supply in cooperation with the Dortmunder Gasrußwerke.
The further expansion of the district heating network is sensible, but must take social aspects into account.
In Dortmund, the traffic turnaround has so far failed.
The proportion of motorized individual transport (MIV) has hardly fallen.
The expansion of public transport and cycle paths is only slowly progressing.
Public transport is the most efficient and socially acceptable mass transport.
Public transport scores points above all because it is space-saving and can be designed to be accessible to all citizens.
The focus must be on the expansion of the rail network.
Cycling is a particularly fair form of mobility: Even children and – thanks to e-bikes – physically impaired people can be on-the-move quickly.
For this to work, the cycle paths must be safe, which is currently not the case in Dortmund.
Cycle paths must not contain ‘green waves’
Cyclists must be protected by their own barriers, just like pedestrians.
Restrictions may only be at the expense of car traffic.
We demand nationwide that the standard speed in cities be set to 30 km/h.
With e-bikes, commuting is possible by bike between towns and cities without any problems.
This requires the necessary cycle infrastructure.
In 2023, 423 pedestrians died in traffic accidents in Germany - more than the previous year (368) Every second citizen in Dortmund - statistically including the very elderly and young children - owns a car.
Noisy, unattractive streets without sufficient shade, poor air quality and pedestrian-unfriendly traffic light sequences deter many people from moving around on foot.
Pedestrians are often overlooked in traffic planning, even though they are the group with the greatest need for protection.
A too large proportion of transport takes place with lorries, which leads to poor traffic and mobility justice.
The Left demands: The examination and introduction of a pilot project for the construction of a Cargo Tram network.
The Stadtbahn and rail network in Dortmund should be used for this purpose to transport goods.
Die Linke Dortmund demands that transport for post and local delivery be brought under municipal control.
Public space belongs to everyone, but is still heavily dominated by car traffic.
Roads, parking spaces and parking garages are very expensive.
Electric cars alone do not solve these problems.
Where cars are indispensable, they should be as light, electric and made of fair produced materials as possible.
Social disadvantage, poverty and exclusion have been a sad reality in Dortmund for many years.
The official action plan "Social City" has hardly relieved these social spaces.
A solidary urban society ensures that everyone can participate in public life – and not only those who can afford it.
For the Left, a social city of Dortmund creates and secures good jobs, fights poverty and inclusion.
Poverty shows a blatant failure of politics, says the Left Dortmund.
All people, regardless of their background or their life situation, have a right to public spaces and respectful treatment.
The focus must be shifted away from repressive measures against poor and homeless people and towards social support, prevention and respect.
The Left is against the establishment of a "wake-up service" that drives homeless people out of the inner city.
Poverty is not combated with bans, fines or expulsions, says Die Linke Dortmund.
The city must take social responsibility and remove bureaucratic and financial hurdles.
The Left demands the end of hopeless and poverty-promoting "Ein-Euro-Jobs" The Dortmund Card should be expanded to a comprehensive social pass and automatically sent out when corresponding benefits are received, the group says.
The plan includes direct measures that represent a type of municipal emergency aid as well as structural changes.
The city of Dortmund urgently needs to take comprehensive measures to help those affected and to ensure permanent housing in a safe and stable environment.
The Left calls for the expansion of the Housing First concept, which provides homeless people with their own accommodation.
The housing reserve programme must be further expanded, as there are simply not enough apartments in Dortmund to meet demand.
Affected people need more than short-term emergency aid - they need sustainable prospects for a life worthy of human beings.
Die Linke is calling for all emergency accommodation to be transferred to municipal ownership.
Die Linke is calling for the expansion of the drug consumption area at Grafenhof as well as the establishment of further drug counseling centers.
Dortmund must also pursue the binding goal of providing permanent accommodation to homeless people within two weeks.
The UN Disability Convention has been in force since 2009, but many of its demands have not yet been implemented on the ground.
In Dortmund, people with disabilities and the chronically ill are still exposed to everyday barriers.
The Left is committed to an inclusive Dortmund that does not exclude anyone and enables self-determined living for all.
The construction of barrier-free, publicly accessible toilet facilities in all districts, parks and central locations.
The Left is also calling for the expansion of psychological and psychiatric counseling services for socially disadvantaged people in order to specifically treat mental illnesses that often accompany poverty and homelessness.
Inclusion as social and professional participation is a human right that belongs to everyone.
Die Linke demands that a disability not restrict political participation.
Polling stations must be selected or adapted accordingly and equipped for the election.
Public buildings and cultural institutions must be equipped with hearing systems and visual signals in elevators.
The Left is committed to an offensive for retrofitting public transport: By.
The health sector is one of the largest employers in the region.
However, there is still a glaring shortage of skilled workers in the field of nursing and geriatric care.
Hospital Reform 2025 aims to strengthen large clinics and centralise services.
This will involve reducing the number of hospitals.
We are against the closure of individual wards for economic reasons.
Instead, we want good care throughout Dortmund: The Left is fighting for comprehensive and needs-based A social life in Dortmund Page 49 A sociallife in Dortmund all medical areas are covered.
The entire Ruhr area is significantly under-supplied.
This primarily affects residents of child-rich city districts such as Nordstadt or Scharnhorst.
The Left is calling for the establishment and expansion of health kiosks in Dortmund.
In a few years 25% of the total population in Germany will require age-related care and support in everyday life.
The municipalities are facing major challenges that must be addressed now.
The Left Party in the Council has, at the end of 2024, provided 200,000 euros for the free scene with a budget decision.
But that is not enough.
Artists often live in precarious circumstances and are 90% supplementary workers at the job center.
Often artists are awarded prizes - without this significantly improving their living conditions.
The Left Party has provided funds for cultural centers such as Dings e.V., Welthaus, Taranta Babu and others.
Die Linke is calling for adequate staffing for the children’s museum Mondo Mio in the Westfalenpark.
A particular concern of ours as anti-fascists is also the Steinwache memorial site.
There is still a lack of sports halls that are barrier-free and therefore accessible to people with disabilities.
The Left promotes the access of sports clubs to the extra-curricular commitment offer at open comprehensive schools.
Organized sports in particular perform valuable educational work, create low-threshold opportunities for social participation and thus contribute to the successful integration of migrants.
The Left has been calling for free admission for Dortmund children and young people in open-air pools during the summer holidays for years.
In Dortmund, around 120,000 senior citizens live, and old-age poverty is increasingly becoming a pressing problem.
Almost every second statutory pension is below 1,000 euros gross, and 7.4% of pensioners (12,980) are dependent on social benefits.
The Left is calling for a minimum pension of 1,400 euros net to effectively combat poverty in old age.
The city of Dortmund should actively promote alternative forms of housing, such as senior citizen WGs and multi-generational houses.
Senior policy is a cross-cutting task.
It must make it easier for older people to access new technical possibilities for coping with everyday life, while at the same time ensuring all public offers remain accessible without digital hurdles.
Digitalization can offer important opportunities to support the mobility of older people, especially those with health problems or other restrictions.
Digital solutions such as exercise programmes, virtual training opportunities and fall prevention technologies can help pensioners to maintain and improve their physical mobility.
Network offices should be established in every municipality to strengthen cooperation between social services, self-help groups and voluntary helpers.
The Left demands for day care centers that are well equipped and available to all children whose parents wish to use them.
On 01.01.2024 there were 34.5% U3 and 86.3% U4 in Dortmund.
New day care centers should be built by municipal developers, to whom no land should be sold.
The profession of educator must become more attractive.
Fair pay for this important job is essential.
There should be no flight from collective bargaining agreements.
Children and young people also have rights.
First and foremost, these are intended to protect them from abuse, exploitation and violence.
However, they also have the right to participation as well as education.
Education is a human right that every child is entitled to, regardless of the social status and income of their parents.
Current education policy contributes significantly to social problems such as limited opportunities in the job market and low incomes.
Education policy must increasingly focus on the promotion of media competence and political education in order to counteract disinformation, social division and polarisation.
asphalt schoolyards must be transformed into green islands to increase the value of play and stay.
particularly expensive teaching materials, such as individual experiments in the natural sciences or materials in the class set, must be available centrally to all schools from the city.
A livable community is based on respect - respect for diverse life concepts and opinions.
Fascist and right-wing populist organizations pursue the exact opposite and rely on exclusion.
Right-wing extremists were able to win individual municipal mandates in 2014.
Neo-fascists and right-wing populists are still present in municipal representations, including in Dortmund.
Five people have been murdered by Nazis in Dortmund since 2001.
There is a likely connection between the Dortmund Nazi scene and the terrorist group “National Socialist Underground” (NSU).
The NSU has killed numerous people in Germany in cold blood – including Mehmet Kubaşık, a Dortmund citizen.
The Left advocates for consistently linking the fight against racism and neo-Nazis with social demands.
The Left will use its function in municipal committees to publicly name police violence against anti-fascists as well as any form of state support for racists, neo-Nazis and racist politics.
The Left is committed to renaming streets and squares that still bear the names of supporters of German fascism or of racists, antisemites and militarists.
We note with concern that the federal government has drastically cut funding for exit programs for right-wing extremism.
The Left faction has a clear basic Against all forms of anti-Semitism!
We are the firewall!
Keep the AfD in check!
Create a solidarity society.
Despite formal gender equality, women and queer people are still exposed to numerous discriminations.
Women still earn significantly less than men and do more unpaid care work.
They are confronted with prejudices, often hit a ‘glass ceiling’ and are underrepresented in leadership positions.
The Left is committed to the preservation and expansion of women’s shelters and safe havens for people affected by or threatened by violence.
Measures for a diverse lifestyle that also take into account queer lifestyles must be developed at the local level.
An end to the preference of marriage as the only recognized lifestyle is necessary – all family forms must be equally supported.
Violence against women is a structural problem that is deeply rooted in patriarchal power relations.
Every third woman in Germany experiences physical or sexualized violence at least once in her life.

Dortmund has a pioneering role in the area of queer services, which should also be extended to neighboring communities.

We work with migrant self-organizations in solidarity projects for politically persecuted and/or victims of war and civil war.
The Left says: We tolerate neither the glorification of violence nor the relativization of war crimes or violations of human rights.
For the Left, local politics and proximity to the citizens are indispensable.
The Left works together with citizens' initiatives and other non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Dortmund and tries to give them a parliamentary voice.
We will fight for improvements for the residents of the city.
These improvements must not be at the expense of the employees in the administration.
In 2020 alone, seven people were killed by the police in NRW.

The Left has introduced the idea of environmental justice into the monitoring systems of the Ruhr Regional Association.
Dortmund has not yet achieved its climate goals.
The Left is calling for a significantly better equipped environmental department in terms of personnel and finances.
We fundamentally reject video surveillance.
It does not create security, but at best, it merely shifts criminality.
A solidarity society.
Rules must apply to everyone, and climate protection must not be a question of income.
It is not acceptable that those who earn more and are better off can continue to afford climate-damaging behaviour.
The ecological footprint of wealthy households is many times larger than that of low-income households.
Dortmund must prepare for extreme weather events such as heavy storms, droughts, heat waves, heavy rainfall events and flooding.
The Left wants to make use of the opportunities offered by major urban development projects in the next electoral period.
For example, the International Garden Exhibition and the plans for the development of a new research and residential quarter on the former site of Hoesch Spundwand und Profile (HSP) offer both potential and risks.
The Left is against the privatisation of public parks and inner-city open spaces such as the Fredenbaum Park or the West Park.
Die Linke wants to make driving bans unnecessary by adhering to the limit values.
Environmental zones are generally to be welcomed, but their effect on the polluted inner city area is too weak.
The wall should in future become a circular promenade with cafes, discos, street theatres, studios and more.
The cycle path is to be expanded on its own tracks.
The water quality in Dortmund is currently quite good.
The use of particle filters - as on the Rhine - could lead to further improvement.
Industrial chemicals, medicines and microplastics do not belong in drinking water.
The Left is calling for soil remediation according to the "polluter pays" principle.
It wants the use of fossil fuels to be ended as quickly as possible.

RWE has integrated the entire power generation division into its own power plant park.
The company's goal is to keep its coal-fired power plants in operation for as long as possible and to have the public purse foot the bill for their later decommissioning.
In Gronau, uranium is enriched to produce fuel rods for nuclear reactors.
In times of increasing militarization of German foreign policy, this plant is of great importance.
The die-off of insects, the decline of breeding birds and the death of native tree species are cause for concern.

The International Garden Exhibition (IGA) in 2027 should be used to create green connections between the north and south of Dortmund along the renaturized course of the Emscher.
The effectiveness of ecological compensation measures should be subject to stronger controls.
Killing wild animals is generally an intervention in the natural balance.
The Messe Jagd & Hund continues to market hunting trips for the killing of protected animals such as elephants, rhinoceroses and lions.
Trips to hunt European migratory birds, which are strictly protected in Germany, are particularly problematic.
Left-wing politics wants to counteract this with suitable measures at the municipal level.
We want to preserve natural living conditions and renature landscapes.
In addition, we want to end the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals.
The Left is calling for a ban on the marketing of trophy hunting trips at the Jagd & Hund trade fair.
It is also calling for hedgehogs to be classified as an endangered species, so that effective measures can be taken to preserve the animal.
They are currently on the watch list of endangered species.
The principle of connection – “whoever orders must also pay’ – is systematically undermined.
The crises of the past – Corona, energy and now recession – have hit the municipal budgets hard.
Dortmund city leadership has been pursuing the ambition for years to outdo other municipalities with costly prestige projects.
Despite the serious errors in the financial regulations, the work in the council is not insignificant.
There are numerous opportunities to cushion the cuts during the recession.
Dortmund is among the laggards in terms of per capita income in Germany.
The city's debts are increasing to around 3.5 billion euros and will rise again massively from 2026.
Dortmund can do a lot itself to distribute its income and expenditure more fairly.
The Left demands: An end to the inter-municipal dumping competition for the lowest municipal taxes and no burden on rents through tax increases.
Tax revenue from the municipal share of income tax is falling, and Dortmund is among the laggards when it comes to disposable income.
Higher income for the people of Dortmund also means better financing of the city through more income tax.
PPP models (public private partnership) are no longer carried out on the initiative of the Left Party, but there are still so-called investor models.
In Dortmund, poverty and unemployment are still a bitter reality.
Over 38,732 people in Dortmund were unemployed in October 2024.
Unemployment often leads to a vicious circle of social problems, including dependence on welfare benefits for a living.
Dortmund needs an active municipal labor market policy that creates good jobs.
One in six people in Dortmund received benefits to secure their livelihood at the end of 2022.
In July 2024, 93,271 people were in needy households.
Dortmund promotes further employment opportunities within the framework of its “Communal Employment Strategy 2020-2030” with the “Participation Opportunities Act’ The city must convert the so-called "1-Euro jobs" into regular, social insurance-covered employment relationships, pay them according to the tariff.
Around 25,000 minors in Dortmund grow up in families who are dependent on citizens' money.
This means that almost every third child in the city lives in poverty.
Around 12,000 people receive basic security in old age or in the event of disability.
The Left is calling for a minimum wage of at least 15 euros per hour by 2025.
The city of Dortmund, together with its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, is by far the largest local employer.
The Left supports this trend and demands an end to the sachgrundlose (i.e.
not based on objective reasons) fixed-term contracts in the city administration and municipal facilities.
We reject the establishment of commercial areas if it is at the expense of local recreation areas and nature conservation areas.
The Left criticises the outsourcing of the former municipal baths to the Sportwelt gGmbH.
The Left demands a digitalisation that leaves no one behind.
It should not be dependent on large corporations, but should rely on open-source solutions.
Data protection and protection against surveillance are of the highest priority.
The Left is calling for a consistent open-source strategy to be implemented in Dortmund.
The goal is to replace proprietary software products from Microsoft, Apple and similar corporations.
The digitalisation of administrative processes can mean relief for citizens and companies.
People without access to digital technologies must not be excluded from the public services of the municipalities.
The Left is critical of smart city projects that are primarily geared towards corporate profits and data collection.
These must voluntarily publish all public data and information such as contracts, meetings with interest groups or good practices online.
Such a portal should be easily accessible and understandable.
At the same time, it must offer open interfaces so that citizens can more easily participate in democratic processes.
The Left demands that the issue of AI is dealt with extremely carefully.
“Artificial intelligence” is currently experiencing a hype, they say.
The Left demands: digital access to public data and documents, high data protection standards in the digitisation of administrative processes, and data sovereignty for citizens.
In an increasingly digital city, where more and more objects and systems are networked with one another, cyber attacks are omnipresent.
We do not want video surveillance in public spaces, especially if it is linked to “intelligent’ applications.
We are against police projects in which
