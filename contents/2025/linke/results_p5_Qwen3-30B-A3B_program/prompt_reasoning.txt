Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze an election program summary from the Left party in Dortmund and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by their policies. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words.

First, I need to go through the provided text and pick out the key areas where the party's policies would impact the city's visual elements. Let me start by skimming through the document.

The Left party talks about housing, public transport, homelessness, accessibility, green spaces, and more. Let me break it down.

1. **Housing**: They mention affordable housing, social housing, and ending homelessness. This would affect the visual aspects like the number of social housing units, the condition of existing housing, and maybe the presence of homeless encampments. So, "Affordable housing developments" and "Homeless encampments reduced" come to mind.

2. **Public Transport**: They want free public transport, expanded bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly streets. Visual aspects here could be "Expanded bike lanes" and "Pedestrian-friendly streets".

3. **Green Spaces**: There's a lot about green areas, replacing asphalt schoolyards with green spaces, and creating nature reserves. So "Green public spaces" and "Renatured urban landscapes" might fit.

4. **Accessibility**: They mention barrier-free facilities, inclusive design, and accessibility for people with disabilities. That points to "Barrier-free infrastructure".

5. **Urban Design**: They talk about removing defensive architecture, improving public spaces, and making streets more welcoming. So "Public space redesign" and "Reduced car dominance" could be relevant.

Wait, I need to make sure each is a visual aspect. Let me check again. 

- Affordable housing developments: Yes, new buildings.
- Homeless encampments reduced: Visual change in areas where people are homeless.
- Expanded bike lanes: Visual change in street infrastructure.
- Pedestrian-friendly streets: Visual design of streets.
- Green public spaces: Parks, green areas.
- Barrier-free infrastructure: Ramps, accessible paths.
- Renatured urban landscapes: Natural areas, green corridors.
- Public space redesign: Overall layout of public areas.
- Reduced car dominance: Less parking, more pedestrian areas.

But the user wants five. Let me pick the top five that are most visually impactful. 

1. Affordable housing developments (new social housing)
2. Expanded bike lanes (visual change in streets)
3. Pedestrian-friendly streets (design elements)
4. Green public spaces (parks, green areas)
5. Barrier-free infrastructure (ramps, accessible paths)

Alternatively, maybe "Homeless encampments reduced" and "Renatured urban landscapes" instead. But the user might prefer the more direct visual aspects. Let me confirm the original text mentions "green islands" for schoolyards, "green connections" via IGA, and "barrier-free" facilities. Also, "defensive architecture" being abandoned. So maybe "Defensive architecture removed" as a visual aspect. 

But the user asked for five. Let me list them:

1. Affordable housing developments
2. Expanded bike lanes
3. Pedestrian-friendly streets
4. Green public spaces
5. Barrier-free infrastructure

That seems to cover the key areas. Each is a visual aspect affected by the policies. I'll check if each is 3-6 words. Yes, they fit. I think that's solid.
