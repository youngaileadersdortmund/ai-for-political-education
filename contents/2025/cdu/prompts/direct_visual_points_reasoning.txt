Okay, I need to analyze the CDU election program summary and identify the five most important visual aspects that would be affected if their policies come into effect. Let me start by reading through the summary carefully.

First, the CDU talks about making Dortmund a sustainable city, improving the city center with lively squares, attractive shops, and safe streets. That makes me think of urban design and public spaces. Then there's mention of newPark, the Hansa Carré, and the development of former areas like HSP, Area 5, and Kaiserstuhl. These are likely to involve new buildings or renovations, affecting the cityscape.

They also mention green roofs, energy-efficient renovations, and geothermal energy. So environmental features and sustainable architecture would be visual aspects. The part about bike & ride facilities, cycle paths, and public transport improvements suggests changes to transportation infrastructure, which would alter the visual appearance of streets and public areas.

The CDU wants to improve public spaces for security and cleanliness, which might involve more lighting, surveillance, or cleaner streets. Also, there's a focus on community centers and meeting points, which could mean new buildings or renovated spaces for social interaction. The "family card" and cultural facilities like the zoo or swimming pools might lead to more public amenities, changing the visual landscape.

I need to pick the top five. Let me list possible ones:

1. City center with lively squares and shops – urban design.
2. Green roofs and energy-efficient buildings – sustainable architecture.
3. Cycle paths and bike & ride facilities – transportation infrastructure.
4. Public spaces for security and cleanliness – maybe more lighting or signage.
5. New community centers and cultural facilities – new buildings or renovated areas.

Wait, but the user wants the visual aspects that would be affected. So I need to describe each as a visual change. Let me check the original text again for more clues. They mention "lively squares," "attractive shops," "safe streets," "green roofs," "photovoltaics," "cycle routes," "public transport," "community centers," "cultural facilities," "smart city" with broadband, and "digital maps."

So possible aspects:

1. Lively, well-designed public squares and streets with shops.
2. Green roofs and solar panels on buildings.
3. Expanded bike lanes and bike & ride facilities.
4. Modernized public transport infrastructure (buses, trams, stations).
5. New or renovated community and cultural centers.

That seems to cover the main visual changes. Now, I need to describe each concisely, in about 25 words total. Each description should be a short phrase, comma-separated. Let me make sure they are visual and specific.
