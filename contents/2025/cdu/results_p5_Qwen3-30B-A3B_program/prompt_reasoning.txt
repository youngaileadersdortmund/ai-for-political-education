Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to analyze the CDU election program summary and identify five important visual aspects of a city's appearance that would be affected by their policies. Each aspect needs to be described in 3-6 words, concise and informative. Then return them as a comma-separated list.

First, I need to go through the program summary and pick out key points related to the city's visual aspects. Let's start skimming through the text.

They mention "a city centre that is inviting again, with lively squares, attractive shops and safe streets." So that's about the city center's appearance. Maybe "Lively city center" or "Attractive retail areas."

Then there's "energy-efficient renovation of houses and the renovation of house facades and green roofs." That points to building facades and greenery. So "Renovated building facades" and "Green roofs."

They talk about "improvements in all areas of transportation, cycle paths, sidewalks, public transport." So infrastructure like bike lanes and sidewalks. "Improved cycling infrastructure" and "Enhanced pedestrian pathways."

Also, "realise the already agreed cycle routes in the whole city as soon as possible and create a digital map." That's about bike routes, so maybe "Expanded bike routes."

Another part mentions "the environment plays a significant role in whether people perceive their living space as livable." So maybe "Enhanced green spaces."

Wait, but I need five. Let me check again. They also mention "floods, fires... disaster protection," but that's more about safety than visual. "Public spaces must be preserved and created" so "Expanded public spaces."

Also, "the city brand is now being managed from a single source" which might relate to branding, but not sure if that's visual. "Modernized public spaces" could be a stretch.

Wait, the user wants visual aspects. So things that you can see. Let's list possible ones:

1. Lively city center (from the part about inviting city center)
2. Attractive retail areas (shops)
3. Renovated building facades (energy-efficient renovation)
4. Green roofs (mentioned)
5. Improved cycling infrastructure (bike paths)
6. Enhanced pedestrian pathways (sidewalks)
7. Expanded bike routes (from cycle routes)
8. Enhanced green spaces (environmental aspects)
9. Modernized public spaces (from city brand and public spaces)
10. Safe streets (from the city center part)

Now, need to pick five. Let's see which are most directly visual. The first five I thought of: Lively city center, attractive shops, renovated facades, green roofs, improved cycling. But maybe "Attractive retail areas" instead of shops. Also, "Safe streets" is a visual aspect. But the user wants 5. Let me check the original text again for more clues.

They also mention "the move of the Technical University into the Hansa Carré" which might affect the skyline or urban design. But that's more specific. Maybe "Modernized university buildings" but that's too specific. Not sure.

Another part: "the development of the former HSP area must be driven forward" which could relate to urban development. But again, maybe not as visual. 

The "newPark" project: "project “newPark” in Dortmund... will be realized." That's a park, so "Expanded urban parks" or "New public parks."

Also, "the city is more than just a place for trade and shopping" so maybe "Diverse commercial areas" but that's not visual.

So compiling the five:

1. Lively city center (from inviting city center)
2. Attractive retail areas (shops)
3. Renovated building facades (energy-efficient)
4. Green roofs (mentioned)
5. Improved cycling infrastructure (bike paths)

Alternatively, "Expanded bike routes" instead of improved. Or "Enhanced pedestrian pathways." Let me check the exact quotes.

Original: "Realise the already agreed cycle routes in the whole city as soon as possible and create a digital map." So "Expanded bike routes."

Also, "improvements in all areas of transportation, cycle paths, sidewalks, public transport" so "Enhanced pedestrian pathways" and "Improved cycling infrastructure."

So maybe:

1. Lively city center
2. Attractive retail areas
3. Renovated building facades
4. Green roofs
5. Expanded bike routes

That's five. Let me check if each is 3-6 words. Yes. Each is concise. Let me confirm they are all visual aspects. Yes, these are all things you can see in a city's appearance. The answer should be a comma-separated list of these five.
