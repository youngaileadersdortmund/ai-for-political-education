91 Municipal Election Program 2025 Municipal Election Program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNENWhat makes Dortmund special?
It's not just buildings, streets or plans – it's you, dear people of Dortmund.
The people who live in our city.
The people who keep the city running every day – despite all the major challenges.
You, who drive to work in the morning, raise children, help friends, care for others, and you, who – often despite your own burdens – volunteer, get involved, and want to change things.
You, who shape Dortmund day by day – sometimes visibly, often quietly in the background.
For that, we say thank you.
And we also say: We see you.
We know that you hold this city together – especially when it gets tough.
That is why it is our task as politicians to listen, to look and to find ways together.
Because the challenges we face are great: the climate crisis, social injustice, rising living costs and a system that is reaching its limits in many places.
But we believe: These challenges can be overcome – if we tackle them together.
With ideas that come from life.
With political courage.
And with the will not just to talk, but to act.
We want Dortmund to remain a livable city for everyone, not just for a few.
A Dortmund that thinks about mobility in a new way – safe, stress-free, barrier-free.
With local public transport that is on time, affordable and well-developed.
With cycle and pedestrian paths that connect, rather than separate.
Our goal is a city in which everyone arrives well – regardless of age, income or residential area.
And in which the transport revolution is not only an ecological, but also a social opportunity.
A Dortmund that leaves no one behind.
In which every child can grow up with the same opportunities.
In which young people are taken seriously and heard.
In which inclusion is lived.
In which housing is not a luxury, but a right.
In which schools are well equipped and healthcare, culture and sport are accessible to all.
In which diversity is seen for what it is: our greatest strength.
A city in which participation is not dependent on language, origin, gender or age, but simply on the common idea of making Dortmund a better place.
Our goal is a city that is not managed, but shaped together with you.
A city that does not put off challenges, but tackles them head on.
A city in which we make the future possible together – with attitude, heart and mind and, most importantly, with you!
MAKE TODAY WHAT IT WILL BE IN 2025 Dortmund is facing major challenges: the climate crisis, rising rents and economic change show that we must act now to make our city future-proof.
We are looking ahead: determined, confident and with a clear attitude.
With a clear plan, we want to make Dortmund strong together with the people of this city – socially, ecologically and economically.
We fight for consistent climate protection and for measures that not only protect our city against the consequences of the climate crisis, but also make it fairer and more livable.
We conserve our A healthy environment with more greenery, clean air and the preservation of biodiversity – for us, our parents and our children.
This also includes how we develop our city: we think about urban planning from the bottom up.
We create lively neighbourhoods, strengthen the districts, promote encounters, participation and mobility that make everyday life easier.
No one should be excluded in Dortmund – either by barriers or by high rents.
Housing should remain affordable – for families, young people in training, senior citizens and everyone who calls Dortmund their home.
We want to strengthen subsidised housing construction, curb speculation and promote new forms of housing that are geared towards the common good.
We also want to consistently align our economy towards the future.
Dortmund has the potential to be a pioneer for a socio-ecological transformation – with innovative companies, strong universities, committed skilled workers and new ideas for crisis-proof inner cities.
We promote good work, local value creation and an economy that serves the people – not the other way around.
This also requires a capable and digital administration that is a service provider for the people.
And we know: Without solid finances, many plans remain just on paper.
That is why we are fighting for fair municipal financing, which will give Dortmund real political scope for design.
Our goal is a city that uses its strengths and does not shy away from challenges, but tackles them – so that Dortmund remains a livable city for everyone.1 Municipal election program 2025 The climate crisis is no longer a distant threat, it has long since arrived in Dortmund.
Hotter and hotter summers, flooded streets and increasing weather extremes show: We must act now to preserve our city.
But we do not see climate protection as just crisis management, but as an opportunity to make our city fairer, greener and more resilient.
Dortmund has set out on the path: Thanks to the GREEN initiative, we have anchored the goal of climate neutrality by 2035 in the city council and developed a clear roadmap with the Climate Air Action Plan.
But we will only achieve a climate-neutral Dortmund together – with citizens, science, business and civil society.
The Climate Council, which we initiated, involves experts in climate policy decisions That is why we are designing climate protection in a socially just way – with measures that protect particularly affected groups.
At the same time, we are investing in sustainable urban development: de-paving, greening and sponge city concepts not only make Dortmund more resistant to extreme weather, but also make it more livable for everyone.
The energy transition is the key to climate neutrality – that is why we want to actively shape it.
By expanding renewable energy, climate-friendly heat supply and greater citizen participation in energy generation, we ensure that the energy transition is not only ecological, but also economical and social.
Climate neutrality is our goal.
We are shaping the way there with determination and a clear strategy to make Dortmund future-proof.
For climate neutrality in 2035.
The goal of climate neutrality must be achieved on all levels to preserve the living conditions for us and future generations.
At the initiative of the Greens, the goal of climate neutrality in 2035 and the comprehensive catalogue of measures for implementation were decided on in the Dortmund City Council with the Climate-Air Action Programme, which In order to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2035, further efforts are needed to implement the action program in all areas.
To this end, we will • strengthen the Climate Agency in the Environmental Office as the responsible unit, so that the implementation of all measures can be efficiently and purposefully coordinated between the parties involved.
• require each department to develop a strategy for implementing measures for its area of responsibility.
• establish the Climate Council and provide it with an advisory position in the Committee on Climate Protection, Environment, Urban Design and Housing (AKUSW).
• demand transparent and up-to-date reporting on progress in climate protection, including an annual CO2 balance sheet, and use the Climate Barometer to tighten up where necessary.
• conclude climate agreements with companies and institutions in Dortmund, with individual measures and measurable goals (“Climate Pact”) and establish monitoring of the results.
• adopt additional measures and tighten up where necessary to achieve climate neutrality, in addition to the Climate-Air Action Program.
For socially just climate protection.
It is the poorest who suffer the most from the escalating climate crisis in Dortmund.
The • The standards for building plans for energy-efficient construction, sustainable materials and floor space consumption.
• The obligation for solar installations and green roofs for new buildings has been decided and is supported by the local authorities.
GREEN WORKS!
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN FOR THE 2025 Local Election Programme Renovation and support.
• Encourage the housing company DOGEWO21 and the Dortmund City Development Company DSG, the housing cooperatives and the private housing companies to offer on-site advice for residents on energy and electricity saving as well as efficient heating and ventilation in cooperation with the Climate Agency and the Consumer Centre.
• Motivate companies with their own building stock with the help of economic development to invest in the energy efficiency of their properties.
• Take into account the energy-efficient renovation of neighbourhoods, for example through district heating networks, heat pumps and photovoltaic systems.
For sustainable construction The construction sector is one of the industries with the highest resource consumption.
At the same time, a lot is still being built in Dortmund.
For us, this means that climate-neutral and sustainable construction must be required and promoted.
We want to offer incentives for the implementation of sustainable construction projects in Dortmund and lead by example in municipal projects.
This should be done in cooperation with the local construction industry.
Sustainability includes the reduction of climate-damaging emissions, energy neutrality, resource efficiency, circularity, barrier-free access and the creation of affordable housing.
All of this also leads to a higher quality of life.
• Establish a municipal consultation for sustainable construction for industrial companies, construction companies and building owners, which provides information on life cycle costs, ecological balance, heating supply, circular economy and other topics.
• Use the full range of municipal possibilities to strengthen timber construction and the use of local materials such as clay, as well as initiate municipal pilot projects.
• Establish the use of reusable building materials and the separation and recycling of building materials in building planning and urban development contracts.
• Publicly market municipal construction projects with a circular economy as a model.
• Apply the Sustainable Construction (BNB) rating system of the Federal • encourage the use of certification systems in the private sector through municipal consulting or through funding programmes that cover the additional costs for planners.
• introduce a demolition moratorium (“demolition stop”) in order to support and protect against excessive burdens through targeted measures from urban development that increase the quality of life in the city.
Measures that increase the quality of life in the city can also contribute to social climate protection during heat or cold periods.
In addition, we will: • if possible, stagger all measures that could lead to increased costs for citizens, so that those who can afford it contribute more.
• offer Dortmund residents electricity from municipal photovoltaic systems through DEW21 at favourable prices with a social tariff.
• continue to finance municipal funding programmes for climate-relevant measures such as solar systems on clubhouses, green spaces, geothermal energy and cargo bikes.
• design the planned citizen fund, which supports regenerative and sustainable energy and climate protection measures, effectively and in a way that is close to citizens.
• involve the Climate Council in the use of the funds from the citizen fund.
• support Climate-neutral modernisation Climate neutrality also includes a supply of climate-neutral, renewable energy forms.
In order to be able to cover the increased demand for energy, energy efficiency in the existing building stock must be further improved.
In the future, rising prices for fossil energy sources will save the money of citizens, companies and municipalities.
For this reason, we will: • energetically renovate the municipal property stock and convert it to a climate-neutral heat supply.
• expand the existing municipal energy consultancy for the climate age and thereby inform about energy-saving renovations.
• also take the interests of tenants into account in energy consultancy and offer tenant consultancy on dealing with energy-saving renovations by their landlords.
• offer consultations for craft businesses in cooperation with the Chamber of Crafts and the IHK, so that they can inform their customers directly about the possibilities of the municipal election programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND.
• check new rainfall quantities and prepare for them in accordance with the Emscher and its tributaries.
• use parking spaces for by means of a relief in the sewage fee.
• Swamp city measures in holistic neighbourhood solutions.
For favourable and renewable energy We will only achieve our climate protection goals if we convert our entire energy supply to renewable energy and use energy more efficiently and sparingly.
The energy transition is not only an electricity transition, but at the same time also a mobility and heat transition.
That is why the individual areas must be networked and coordinated with one another.
At the same time, the future electricity supply should no longer be in the hands of just a few large companies.
The citizen and energy cooperatives will be the energy producers of the future and create added value in the city.
With the switch to renewable energy, we will gradually be able to do without such sources of previous energy generation that are contrary to climate and species protection.
• together with the economic development department actively support companies in the construction of photovoltaic systems and in applying for funding.
• also offer advice to companies on the efficient use of hydrogen technologies.
• strengthen the vocational training required for the energy transition, such as solar technicians and heating engineers, by creating offers and advice for school leavers and refugees with technical knowledge.
• work to ensure that the municipal companies DONETZ and DEW21 support tenant electricity models with the most accessible possible registration, advice and advertising measures.
• drive forward the introduction and implementation of tenant electricity models in cooperation with the municipal housing company DSG and DOGEWO21.
• use the municipal possibilities such as building codes and urban planning contracts to establish the preservation of the existing stock, energy neutrality, barrier-free access, social housing and the protection of open spaces and urban biodiversity.
For a climate-resilient Dortmund: heavy rain, flooded streets, persistent drought and increasingly extreme high temperatures: the climate crisis has long since reached Dortmund.
Our responses to this are de-paving, a water-sensitive sponge city and more greening.
This not only creates retention areas, but also enables a better handling of heat and fine dust and at the same time makes a contribution to biodiversity.
The “green treasure” • enhance small existing green spaces, which contribute to the sponge city, biodiversity, cooling and recreation with trees and wildflower meadows.
• use climbing plants in urban spaces for shading and greening.
• drive forward the roll-out of sustainable development of industrial areas, which we initiated, and support companies in the design of a natural company site with trees, plants, roof and facade greening for better living conditions for employees and fewer air pollutants.
• inform homeowners about the possibilities and advantages of roof and facade greening.
• promote increased greening of roofs and facades, including in industrial areas.
• create more small biotopes in the city, including in industrial areas.
• plant more city trees.
• green bus stops.
• lay grass tracks instead of gravel on the above-ground sections of the city railway.
• use the existing rain retention systems, streams and canals.
Municipal election program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND • support the project of a university-owned wind turbine of the TU Dortmund.
• Use biomass plants to react flexibly to the fluctuating feed-in from solar and wind energy, whereby the bio-waste is utilised without the need to purchase biomass from factory farming.
• Build district storage facilities for energy security.
Due to its high population and industrial density, Dortmund offers optimal conditions for long-distance and local heating networks and a diversified heat generation from production processes in industry, biomass, solar thermal energy, waste water, geothermal energy and more.
In order to reduce the enormous proportion of heat supply in CO2 emissions, we will: • Critically evaluate the results of municipal heat planning, transparently present them, bring the result to a concrete implementation plan and create planning security for citizens.
• Promote the combination of different energy sources for heat supply.
• Continue the expansion of the district heating network by DEW21, consistently use financial support and best support local implementation by the city.
• Operate district and long-distance heating networks in an energy-efficient manner, i.e.
With the lowest possible flow temperature, and integrate heat storage to cushion heat load peaks.
• End the generation of heat by use the Dokom21 for district heating and local heating.
• implement the possibilities for heat recovery from waste water.
• use the waste heat from biomass plants for district heating.
• carry out a potential analysis for the use of deep geothermal energy as a supplement to existing, near-surface geothermal potential.
• require DEW21 to advertise the use of smart meters, as the use of dynamic electricity prices relieves the electricity grid and reduces expensive electricity prices during peak load times, in order to meet the national expansion targets.
• communalize DEW21 and especially the networks for a publicly-oriented energy supply.
• demand the establishment of a “heat team” in the climate agency, which will deal with the planning and project management of heat projects (island solutions, citizen energy cooperatives, commercial waste heat utilization, etc.) in a targeted and cross-sectoral manner and initiate projects, advise existing initiatives, point out ways of financing and mediate partnerships.
For the expansion of renewable energies For the energy transition, we need the expansion of renewable energies, which has also gained momentum in • Concentrate free-space solar installations on spoil heaps, brownfield sites, conversion sites or fallow land, as well as along infrastructure axes.
• Provide free city roofs to citizen energy cooperatives to build photovoltaic installations in cooperation with the city.
• Inform citizens about the possibilities of balcony power plants.
• Implement a pilot project for an energy-autonomous district that is 100% self-sufficient with renewable energy, has developed power storage and even feeds surplus energy into the grid.
• Utilise the potential wind energy in Dortmund, which is made possible by the improved framework conditions of the state government and the regional plan for the 2025 local elections.
• Further expand the consulting services for private households by strengthening the Klimaagentur (climate agency) in terms of personnel.
• Use district heating networks as cooling networks in the summer.
Local elections programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUNDA city that not only grows, but thrives.
A city that does not destroy, but preserves – for us This also leads to a decrease in the variety of bird species.
These effects are a loss of our quality of life and a concrete danger for our future.
The reason for this is the ever-decreasing living spaces of wild animals and insects, as well as urban light pollution and noise.
The latter not only affects our quality of life, but also has a negative impact on our health.
In order to protect biodiversity and thus our future, • the developed biodiversity strategy of the city must be implemented quickly and effectively.
• Urban gardening projects must be supported in the search for space and in bureaucratic hurdles, and must continue to be financed through Querbeet Dortmund.
• Useful garden systems such as the UmweltKulturPark in Barop must be supported and the creation of such gardens must be promoted.
• The ban on gravel gardens in new building areas must also be monitored in the following years.
• The conversion of gravel gardens into green gardens must be promoted by giving away plants and through consultation services in cooperation with garden and landscape construction companies.
• A bird- and insect-friendly gardening on municipal areas must be strengthened.
• prohibit the operation of lawn robots in the twilight and at night, following the example of the city of Cologne, in order to protect hedgehogs and small animals, which are active at this time.
• work to preserve hedges, natural stone walls and greenery, to refrain from using pesticides and to create new small bodies of water.
• maintain the ban on glyphosate on municipal areas.
• protect animals and insects by reducing and dimming bright neon signs and building lights.
• protect renatured watercourses and further naturalize flowing and still water bodies (for example Mühlenbach - see between Jungferntal and Westerfilde).
• call on the EDG and the Greenery Department to replace petrol-powered small and large machines in street cleaning and green maintenance with electrically powered machines for environmental and nature protection.
Dortmund is a green city.
We want to preserve the environment in our city and make Dortmund climate-friendly, species-rich and livable, because a healthy environment means better air, cooler summers, less noise and more quality of life for the people in our city.
That is We want to seal off areas and allow the natural development of valleys.
We want to strengthen all of this for a long-term livable Dortmund.
In doing so, we rely on sufficiency in order to conserve resources in all areas: From construction to urban development to trade, we promote alternatives that do not trigger new resource consumption.
We are convinced that we must live in Dortmund in harmony and with respect for nature.
We are • planting 5000 future trees, • subsidizing 1000 € per green roof, • adopting the biodiversity strategy in order to secure biotopes and compensation areas.
• doubling the area for natural forest development with the forest concept.
• banning gravel gardens for the sake of species diversity.
• promoting the conversion to organic agriculture through longer lease agreements.
• measures against light pollution: with LED, dimmable lanterns and insect-friendly light.
• preserving the Kreuzgrundschule – for the building subsidies and the architecture.
• Free bulky waste collection day implemented in all districts.
• Zero-waste fund for initiatives established.
• Industrial area in Brechten prevented.
• Waste investigation department against wild dumping established.
• Over 900 trees of regional fruit varieties given away in the fruit tree campaign.
• Deposit rings implemented in the city centre.
• More healthy organic food introduced in municipal day care centres.
Municipal election programme 2025 • Implement, develop and expand the lighting concept to avoid light pollution.
• Continuously develop the city's noise action plan and implement measures to reduce noise.
• Reduce traffic noise by further introducing 30 km/h speed zones with the aim of achieving the most extensive possible speed limit of 30 km/h.
• introduce a “biodiversity bonus” for the natural conversion of existing commercial outdoor areas.
Trees and forests offer many advantages for us and nature: they bind CO2 and fine dust in the air, strengthen the heat resistance of the city through shade and natural cooling, ensure the desegregation of areas, offer nesting places for birds and enhance the city and landscape view.
Forests in the city also offer far-reaching, positive effects on climate, biodiversity and quality of life.
With the decision of the ecological forestry concept, which replaces the forestry concept from 1993, we have already come a long way.
Now it is time to implement it.
• identify needs for improving the stock of street trees and street greenery and, in particular, make proposals for streets without any greenery in residential areas.
• replant dead trees on existing tree islands, replant empty tree islands and establish new tree islands in order to achieve the already decided goal of an additional 1000 trees.
• use location-appropriate and climate-resistant trees.
• preserve and maintain old and significant city trees.
• distribute the watering of the trees • to ensure and monitor the success of 10% of the forest area as forest for natural development (“the forests of tomorrow”) in the ecological forest concept that has just been decided.
• to further increase the proportion of natural development in which dead wood in the forest is left as a habitat for insects and fungi.
• to promote the implementation of ecological forestry among private forest owners.
• to preserve the municipal forest and take precautionary measures against damage from drought, forest fires, storms and insect infestations.
• to implement the sponge forest concept, based on the example of the Arnsberger forest, also for Dortmund forests.
• to understand the municipal forest as a natural and cool recreational area for citizens, but at the same time to protect it from damage caused by excessive human influence, for example through avoiding litter, keeping dogs on a leash and the obligation to use paths.
• to plant a Tiny Forest (micro forest) on a remaining area in a densely populated residential or commercial area as a model experiment for a climate adaptation measure.
Fresh air The heat summers of the last few years have shown how Adherence to EU fine dust limits is not only a matter of environmental protection, but also of social justice, since people with low incomes often live in particularly polluted areas.
We are fighting against all types of health-damaging and carcinogenic emissions.
• Continue to analyze the pollution levels across the entire area and gradually expand the permanent measuring network to predict further developments.
• Ensure that the remaining fresh air corridors and cold air generation areas are preserved in urban planning and create new fresh and cold air supply through new greening.
• Promote air quality in the city through additional greening of squares, facades and roofs and through more trees, while keeping an eye on heat islands.
• Reduce the contribution of urban traffic to air pollution through speed reductions, the promotion of public transport and cycling and the increase in the proportion of electric cars.
• Continue to fight for the dismantling and against the expansion of Dortmund Airport.
For clean water According to the Federal Environmental Agency, heavy metals, medication residues and even microplastics are increasingly entering our rivers and waterways via municipal wastewater.
They pollute the biotopes in the waterways • continue the renaturation of the Emscher and its tributaries, preserve and protect the surrounding biotope from development.
• strive for the renaturation of other streams in order to implement the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive.
• work towards better education of farmers and consumers in order to maintain the good quality of drinking water in Dortmund.
For natural agriculture We do not see agricultural land use as an interim solution on the way to residential and commercial development.
However, the agricultural land in Dortmund has decreased by almost half since 1950.
The remaining land is absolutely essential to preserve for reasons of landscape protection and is an important part of regional food production and supply.
Therefore, we will: • use the role of the city as landlord of the majority of agricultural land to promote the conversion to organic agriculture with long-term lease agreements and fee discounts.

• We will demand a strengthening of the agricultural circular economy.
For waste avoidance We produce more and more waste in Dortmund and thereby waste valuable resources – both in the form of raw materials and through the high expenditure for waste disposal.
Therefore, it is a claim on the municipal politics to promote a change in thinking and to create the conditions so that products are used longer and more often, repaired, used in parts or the components are recycled Instead, we want to make the path of waste from consumers to recycling as loss-free as possible.

• Introduce appraisals of used furnishings in the handling of collected and delivered bulky waste and promote the separation into reusable, repairable, reworkable, partially recyclable and disposable parts.
• Maintain the extended opening hours of the six recycling centers in Dortmund and open two recycling centers from Monday to Saturday until 18:00.
• Instruct the municipal administration and all public institutions All too often their well-being is put behind profit or comfort.
We see it as our duty to stand up for defenceless creatures in our society and to be the advocates of the voiceless.
Our goal is a Dortmund in which people and animals live in harmony with each other and we prevent animal suffering wherever possible.
To achieve this, we will: • better finance the animal shelter.
• improve the veterinary emergency services.

For an intact environment – everywhere We look at the environment in the city with a positive vision.
We see a healthy environment in Dortmund as a great advantage for the people of Dortmund, which justifies and makes necessary restrictions in some areas.
• strengthen the environmental department within the administration.
• qualitatively improve the function of compensation areas in the event of non-avoidable sealing of areas.
• more strictly control the ecological preservation of existing compensation areas.
Municipal Election Programme 2025 Our vision is a green city, in which all people can feel comfortable, contribute and develop – regardless of age, origin or life situation.
With green spaces, lively neighbourhood centres, a common good-oriented land policy and democratic co-determination, For lively neighbourhoods We create places where living, working, leisure, supply and community are seamlessly combined.
This promotes social encounters, reduces commuting times, strengthens local trade and production and revitalises neighbourhoods.
A clever mix of residential space, commercial space, social infrastructure, learning spaces, cultural offerings and green spaces makes neighbourhoods more resilient to the challenges of the future and increases the quality of life for all people – for a sustainable and lively Dortmund.
Public spaces bring people together regardless of their background, gender, income and age.
The aim is a city of short distances on a human scale.
We create public spaces, green spaces close to home and inclusive living spaces for all people.
We will: • align neighbourhoods with the needs of the people who live there, with a housing supply that meets demand, social facilities such as childcare centres, meeting centres and care facilities, as well as a local retail supply close to home and good public transport connections that are always directly considered.
• show the strength of Dortmund and revive the neighbourhood structures to achieve the goal of a 15-minute city, in which a dense supply structure and • Upgrade courtyards in residential areas through more greenery and mixed use.

• Create barrier-free public spaces, public places and public infrastructure such as public transport stops immediately, so that senior citizens, children and people with disabilities can move around the city safely and independently.
• Create car-free and traffic-calmed residential areas, for example by applying the proven concept of super blocks from Barcelona or circulation concepts such as those in Ghent or Amsterdam.
• Set the goal of urban development along railways and thus close to • Restart for the new planning of Kampstraße: climate-resilient, barrier-free, sealed.
• Prepare new • Guidelines for climate protection with solar roofs and greening as well as quotas for subsidized living space in urban planning contracts regulated.

• create a mix of different types of housing, from (subsidized) apartment buildings to densification in areas with single-family house structures to multi-generational and community housing projects, and thus promote housing diversity and social mixing in Dortmund at the district level.
For an attractive city center A livable city center is the heart of a future-proof Dortmund.
It must be a place where people like to stay, shop, work, live and spend time together.
Dortmund's city center is facing major challenges: economic change with vacancies, visible social inequalities, traffic congestion and the climate crisis require decisive action.
We want to make the city center a space for encounters and divers • increase the quality of the living environment through more urban greenery, better seating options, children's play areas and event locations.
• support the new planning for Kampstraße, which was initiated by the Green Party in the Council, in order to develop this central axis of our town centre into an attractive backbone of a future-proof town centre with a mix of residential, commercial, retail, gastronomy, greenery, culture, sport and nightlife.
• strengthen the economy and in particular small-scale retail.
• creatively repurpose existing and future vacant spaces and also strive for mixed-use concepts with funding.
• establish further pedestrian zones in order to increase the quality of the living environment.
• concentrate the demand for parking in underground car parks with sufficient capacity and make the public space more attractive with outdoor gastronomy, promenades and greenery.
• bring tradespeople and businesses into the town centre in order to contribute to the revitalisation, promote local production and increase added value.
• support the plans of the TU Dortmund to bring our university landscape into the town centre.
• further promote the issue of housing within the Wall • develop a common welfare index that focuses on car-free areas, cultural offerings, good accessibility, greening and climate adaptation, satisfaction, vacancy rates, sense of security, participation and other key figures in order to measure the sustainable development of the city centre in the long term.
• establish a market hall of the future that also includes fair and equitable car-free offers.
• launch an initiative called “Child-friendly City” with all the actors in Dortmund’s city centre in order to make the indoor and outdoor spaces even more family-friendly.
For a fair land policy Land is a finite resource and the basis for housing, work, green spaces and sustainable urban development.
Speculation endangers affordable housing and social justice.
A fair land policy requires clear priorities: to treat land as a common good and to use it sustainably.
We want to ensure that an active municipal land policy paves the way for design options that serve the common good – for a socially, ecologically and economically sustainable city.
Dortmund should be a city in which the basic resource of land serves people, not profit.
• focus on the redevelopment of land and • introduce basic tax C for land mobilisation, which also includes a basic tax on unbuilt land in order to curb land speculation.
• allocate urban areas mainly in usufruct and in competitive situations preferably to non-profit or free-standing organisations, so that in future the democratic majority will decide on the development of the city and not investors, heterogeneous ownership structures will be possible at the district level and social needs can be met.
• only sell urban areas to private investors in well-founded cases.
• demand the establishment of a land and property fund of the city corporation for the acquisition of land and property in the interests of future-oriented urban development, which will be used when the city itself is not in a position to do so financially.
• make more use of concept awards to allocate land to investors on the basis of qualitative criteria, for example according to offers of subsidised housing, the promotion of alternative mobility or ecological construction, and in doing so give preference to non-profit investors.
• preserve agricultural land in the city area and not convert it into residential land.
• prioritise the fight against the housing shortage in • Supermarkets will be built with residential buildings on multiple levels as standard.
Democratic participation The city belongs to everyone who lives in it – and that is how urban development should be designed.
Democratic participation means involving people early in decisions and giving them a real say.
Whether it is new construction projects, the design of green spaces or traffic planning: only together can we find solutions that reflect the needs of the urban community.
Transparent processes, low-threshold offers and diverse opportunities for co-determination are the key to building trust and increasing the quality of life in Dortmund for everyone.
Because urban development is most successful when all perspectives are taken into account.
That is why we will • involve people, initiatives and associations on the ground early in planning processes and create new formats for this that appeal to everyone and invite them to participate – even beyond legal requirements.
This enables people to actively help shape their own living environment, to contribute ideas and to strengthen the community with their neighbourhood.
• establish a staff unit for the participation of children and young people in urban planning and development projects in order to take their interests into account to a greater extent in urban development.
• promote and support neighbourhood-based local mobility concepts together with For a good life in Dortmund A city only comes to life through its people.
The city of Dortmund is characterised by its diversity – and that is precisely its strength.
A good way of living together needs places of encounter and coexistence that are accessible to all people equally and without obstacles.
We want to promote social togetherness and create shared spaces in which all people are welcome.
Whether in neighbourhoods, clubs or public spaces: our city should be a place where no one is excluded.
• To expand schools into community centres, in which the school, clubs, social initiatives and the neighbourhood are structurally networked, with the school becoming an anchor for coexistence in the neighbourhood with offers such as co-working spaces, therapeutic practices, a neighbourhood canteen and afternoon activities.
• To strengthen meeting places for people in the neighbourhood and to upgrade public spaces to places of social life again, while at the same time creating spaces for neighbourhood meetings and initiatives that promote dialogue between people in the district.
• To make meeting places free of consumption available to people of different generations, for example by entering into a dialogue with the churches about the possible conversion of their often centrally • Continue to promote urban gardening initiatives and community gardens.
• Continue to consistently expand publicly accessible and inclusive sports facilities, as these promote health and are also places to meet.
Municipal Election Programme 2025 A home is more than four walls and a roof over your head.
It is the place where we find peace, where we grow up, where we shape our lives.
But for more and more people in Dortmund, this is becoming an existential question: Can I still afford my rent?
Is moving to a larger apartment even possible?
Where can I find senior-friendly, barrier-free living space?
This makes affordable housing one of the most important social issues of our time.
These developments are also clearly noticeable in Dortmund.
Since 2019, the average net cold rent has risen from €7.00 to €8.41 per m², which corresponds to an increase of over 20 %.
There is no sign of an improvement in the situation.
The vacancy rate was only 1.9% at the end of 2023 and the number of socially subsidised apartments is constantly decreasing.
It is becoming increasingly difficult for families, young people, couples, single parents, senior citizens and many others to find affordable housing.
Housing should not be a luxury.
It is a basic right that we must protect.
The introduction of the rent brake in Dortmund by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia from March 2025 is an important step, as it shows the dramatic situation on the Dortmund housing market.
We need more social housing construction, stricter rules against speculation and we need to create more living space.
We are committed to ensuring that Dortmund remains a city where everyone can find a home – regardless of their income.
Affordable housing is a basic right.
That is why we are committed to ensuring that all people in Dortmund can find affordable housing and do not have to worry about losing their home.
In particular, we must support those who, for various reasons, have difficulty finding a place on the general housing market.
We aim to ensure that rent should not exceed 30% of disposable income.
• expand the quota for social housing to 40% in new development plans.
• additionally offer at least 10% of the apartments in each new development area in the so-called price-capped segment, i.e.
with square metre prices between social rent and asking rent, which is secured by a town planning agreement.
• consistently implement and expand the “Housing First” approach to support the homeless.
• promote barrier-free and senior-friendly housing.
• waive the distribution of profits from DOGEWO21 to the city in order to provide it with further equity capital for investments.
• not sell any municipal residential properties.
• advocate for the acquisition of rental agreements by the city in order to maintain the stock of socially supported housing.
• consistently implement all improvements and scope for tenant protection legislation for Dortmund and in particular for DOGEWO21 and DSG, and work towards stronger tenant protection at a • expand the city's housing reserve programme to better mediate housing in emergency situations.
• set up a housing exchange with the Dortmund housing industry, in which apartments can be exchanged voluntarily, at a comparable price per square metre and, if possible, in the same neighbourhood, in order to find a suitable apartment more easily for the respective living situation, for example, if family planning leads to a higher need for space or, conversely, if the children move out.
• protect our socially mixed, colourful neighbourhoods with social preservation clauses from being driven out during the course of construction.
Dortmund needs a realistic strategy to create more living space.
The best approach is to use existing potential: expand buildings, convert unused office and commercial space into living space, convert attic spaces and convert misused and vacant spaces.
• more subsidised housing construction through the municipal housing concept with a quota of 30 %.
• also apply the rent brake in Dortmund.
• with the Dortmund City Development Company DSG, create municipal housing space.
• reserve 10 % of the city's land for cooperative housing projects.
• initiate social preservation clauses.
• initi Municipal election programme 2025 Reactivate buildings.
However, without the construction of new residential buildings, it will not work.
Municipal housing companies must play a central role here and create additional living space to ensure high quality at the same time as affordability.
Serially constructed residential buildings (pre-fabrication of components or modules in the factory and assembly on site) can make a powerful contribution to quickly and inexpensively creating living space if they are built sustainably.
• Strongly promote cooperatives and community-oriented building communities to increase the non-profit housing stock.
• Build more housing through DOGEWO21 or Dortmunder Stadtentwicklungsgesellschaft (DSG), especially subsidised housing.
• Buy problem properties from the city and renovate them together with GrünBau or similar institutions to create additional affordable living space.
• Combat rent gouging and the individual rental of sleeping places, etc.
consistently combat the legal and order situation for immigrants from Southeast Europe.
• serial construction in municipal housing projects • explicitly allocate areas for the construction of apprentice and student dormitories and expand student housing in cooperation with the Studierendenwerk, also in the city centre.
• ensure more living space in existing buildings, i.e.
create living space without additional space requirements by building on top of parking lots, administrative buildings or by converting empty office buildings.
• convert empty commercial buildings into living space, for example within the framework of the federal programme “Gewerbe zu Woh - • work to ensure that living space is used as such and use legal means against empty living space, including expropriation of living spaces that have been empty for longer than two years.
• allow the expansion of buildings in existing residential areas.
• promote, simplify and support the expansion of attics.
• include barrier-free living as a mandatory criterion in urban planning competitions.
• abolish parking space certificates for cars so that new housing construction is not hindered by expensive underground parking spaces or a lack of space.
Municipal Election Programme 2025: clear future prospects.
We are focusing on regional value creation chains, new urban production forms and climate-neutral development paths.
With the Technical University of Dortmund and the University of Applied Sciences, we have strong partners to combine economic change, education and social progress.
After all, we are shaping economic development as part of sustainable urban development, with a focus on climate justice, social compensation, meaningful land use and regional cooperation.
The city must play an active role in this: promoting, networking and steering – for an economy that creates the future.
For climate-neutral business Climate protection and economic development must go hand in hand in Dortmund.
Sustainable business methods not only offer ecological advantages, but also open up new opportunities for employment, innovation and regional value creation.
In this context, we are focusing on innovative and future-proof concepts that strengthen the regional economy.
We are creating concrete incentives for this, e.
g.
Climate protection guidelines for trade, the expansion of the sustainable shopping center plan and the promotion of energy-efficient commercial space.
Renewable energies and green technologies are to become the standard in industry.
Emission-free delivery concepts and micro depots will relieve the city, while we will specifically promote the circular economy, sustainable innovations and community-oriented companies.
We will orient ourselves to the vision of the common good economy – for an economy that combines social responsibility, ecological sustainability and economic strength.
Dortmund is to become a pioneer of a modern, future-oriented economic region.
For this we will: • develop specific guidelines for climate protection in trade that support retail and industry and optimize their production and sales processes without endangering climate protection.
• further promote the sustainable shopping center plan for retail trade in order to establish sustainable and resource-saving business models that minimize the use of space and at the same time integrate environmentally friendly concepts such as urban mining and the use of recycled materials.
• make the energy supply of industrial companies more sustainable by promoting renewable energies in particular and promoting the We want to use these potentials to shape change in a fair way: with economic development that takes on ecological responsibility, enables social progress and offers all people participation and prospects.
We want to keep skilled workers in the region, strengthen educational and training opportunities and further develop jobs according to social and ecological criteria.
This requires a new orientation of Dortmund's economic development.
People and the environment are at the center of our economic policy.
We want to promote sustainable economic development that combines climate protection, resource conservation and future-oriented innovation.
Good work means fair pay, collective bargaining, co-determination, health protection and equal opportunities - regardless of educational background or origin.
Another focus is scientific promotion.
We want to strengthen Dortmund as a location for technological and social innovation by closely linking research and practice, strengthening the university locations and expanding cooperation with companies.
At the same time, we are working on lively, crisis-resistant inner cities in which sustainable trade, creative concepts and quality of stay go hand in hand.
The industry, logistics and crafts also need affordable housing in trainee homes for apprentices.
Roll • Dortmund's companies are encouraged to assess their social impact in terms of climate protection, social justice and participation.
• A one-stop shop for the trades is being set up to implement the municipal election programme 2025, offering young people from other regions affordable housing in order to work and live in Dortmund, thereby strengthening the bond between apprentices and the city and supporting their professional and social integration.

• The employment strategy is to be developed further in cooperation with companies in order to enable better access to jobs for the unemployed and less qualified people and at the same time counteract the shortage of skilled workers.
• In doing so, we will promote cross-industry transitions in order to offer people a perspective who want to change their profession or complete their training.
• We will support the integration of long-term unemployed people even more effectively by offering targeted qualification and further education programmes and by facilitating the integration into the labour market through internships and qualification offensives • Promote the creation of jobs in the field of renewable energy and sustainable technology to accelerate the transition to a green economy and create sustainable jobs in the long term.

For women in MINT professions Women are still underrepresented in MINT professions (i.e.
professions in the fields of mathematics, computer science, natural sciences and technology).
The promotion of women in MINT professions is therefore a key task in order to drive forward economic and social change and effectively counteract the shortage of skilled workers.
Women must be made more visible as leaders and role models and actively encouraged to take up technical professions.
At the same time, we need do and the Chaos Computer Club and thereby inspire more women to pursue these professions.
• Make role models for women in MINT professions visible by enabling successful women to present themselves as role models who encourage young women to participate in these industries.
• Establish mentoring programs for women in MINT professions to promote the exchange between experienced experts and young talents and to facilitate entry into the industries.
For urban production and smart factory The future of industry lies in sustainable and resource-saving production.
The transition to smart and decentralized production methods requires new approaches and technologies.
Urban production centers and smart factories offer the potential to promote innovative and sustainable production methods.
To this end, we will: • promote sustainable production methods by supporting companies that use resource-saving and innovative production methods with an eye to the circular economy and urban farming.
For promoting young talent For Dortmund as a business location, it is of central importance to set the right impulses for a sustainable and future-proof development.
By promoting innovations and strengthening the qualifications of the population, we want to set the course for a resilient and We want to awaken interest in innovative professions (for example solar technician, craftsperson with a focus on climate-friendly technology, etc.) by promoting programmes and initiatives that enable access to innovative professions and thus lay the foundation for a skilled workforce.
• Create labs and workshops for children to enable practical experience in technical, creative and sustainable areas, to promote an interest in future-oriented professions at an early stage and to bring the offers to schools to make the projects accessible to everyone.

• provide more data as open data, in order to remove obstacles and administrative processes for obtaining data.
For successful founding in Dortmund, we must offer founders an environment in which they can not only successfully start their companies, but also grow and prosper in the long term.
By promoting university spin-offs and start-ups, we want to ensure that innovative companies remain in Dortmund and can grow here.
To this end, we will • promote university spin-offs in Dortmund, so that companies that originate from Dortmund universities do not move to other cities, but remain in Dortmund and • Support founders in the long term through growth promotion and professionalization, in order to promote the establishment of Smart Factories in Dortmund, by promoting digital production processes and Industry 4.0 technologies in small and medium-sized enterprises and establishing innovative production methods, especially in the Phoenix West, the port district and the Technology Center Dortmund, which we will position as a showcase for urban production in the region.

To this end, we would like to establish creative event formats and discussions that facilitate the exchange between both sectors.
In addition, Dortmund must be positioned as an international center for research and innovation.
By promoting international cooperation and improving the quality of life for foreign experts, we want to establish Dortmund as an attractive location for highly qualified workers and researchers.
To this end, we will • make scientific knowledge accessible to the general public by promoting events such as ring lectures and other formats that make science understandable and exciting for all people and present them centrally in the city.
• strength Our goal is to further develop Dortmund as an attractive scientific location with international influence.
With particularly good study and living conditions, a strong connection to practice and an open access to scientific knowledge for all.
For this, we rely on easily accessible, lively university locations, new spaces for exchange and networking as well as clear strategies for research, innovation and securing skilled workers.
For strong universities.
The connection between science, urban society and the economy is crucial to develop new solutions and to drive innovation in Dortmund.
Through stronger cooperation between research institutions and companies, we want to strengthen the innovative power of the city.
For this, we will: • strengthen the cooperation between science and business by supporting research initiatives that enable direct exchange between academic institutions and companies and thus develop practice-oriented solutions.
• improve the connection of the university and the university of applied sciences to public transport by increasing the frequency of the S-Bahn and bus lines to make access to the universities easier.
• promote a better connection of the university to the city center by intensifying the expansion of the cycle network in particular, to improve accessibility.
• support the university and the university of applied sciences in settling in the city The city should lead by example and set sustainability, transparency and independence as the focus for procurement, software use and infrastructure.
Open source solutions, fair procurement criteria and ecological standards are central instruments.
Administration and digitalisation are closely linked.
Only if both are designed for the future and implemented responsibly can Dortmund be a viable, just and modern city for all.
For a sustainable administration The city administration offers numerous services for citizens, who have increasingly suffered from long waiting times in recent years.
At the same time, it is responsible for preparing and implementing political decisions, where the list of outstanding decisions is getting longer and longer.
In order for the proposals for improving our city, which have been made by politicians, citizens and all stakeholders, to become effective, we must urgently address the problems in our administration in a structured and short-term manner.
Therefore, we will: • have an external evaluation of all important administrative processes with a view to time and cost efficiency, performance, digitisation and customer friendliness carried out and, in the context of a consistent digital transformation, also consider the use of innovative approaches such as process mining.
with future workshops or digital participation, whereby every proposal should be checked for feasibility within a certain period of time.
• adjust the opening hours of administrative offices to the realities of life of people who work in shifts, care for children or relatives or cannot come to the citizens' services during the current opening hours for other reasons.
• offer information on services and citizens' services in all frequently occurring languages and in easy language.
• expand the newly introduced offer of citizens' suitcases, with which citizens' services are mobile in senior centers, health facilities, in prison or in other locations.
ADMINISTRATION AND DIGITALIZATION A citizen-oriented administration forms the backbone of a functioning urban society.
It is responsible for implementing political decisions, offering central services and shaping how livable and just urban life is.
Above all, however, it is also the place where citizens encounter the state directly.
In the administration, it becomes tangible whether democracy works, whether participation is taken seriously and whether everyday processes are organized in a reasonable manner.
However, in Dortmund it shows that many administrative areas are overloaded.
Long waiting times, a growing number of unresolved tasks and slow digital To achieve this, we are relying on comprehensive structural improvements, new digital tools and greater involvement of the city's society.
We want an administration that is not only better organised, but also approachable, open to learning and innovation.
Processes should be faster, more comprehensible and more user-friendly.
At the same time, we want to improve the working conditions for our employees and make the administration an attractive, diverse and responsible employer.
Digital solutions can significantly improve the quality of administration.
They save time, relieve employees and create new access points for all people.
For this change to be successful, digital offers must be easy to understand, barrier-free and secure.
Even people without digital end devices or with support needs should continue to have access to all services.
• Training at the city administration made significantly more inclusive and diverse.
• A staff ceiling introduced for sustainable personnel planning.
• Bicycle leasing for municipal employees.
• Digital citizen applications improve citizen participation.
• Improving the city's communication with the doline.
• Introducing digital payment methods in the citizens' services.
The municipal election program 2025 and the municipal enterprises will each be at least half-staffed with women.
• Also, the equal treatment of severely disabled people should be a priority.
• Continuing to enable job and task changes within the entire municipal corporation and supporting this with further training opportunities.
• Further promoting the company health program to promote the health of employees and reduce the sickness rate.
• Establishing a municipal occupational health service at the Dortmund Clinic, as external service providers have been used so far.
• Creating "silver competence teams" in the administration to specifically use the knowledge, experience and networks of older employees.
The city of Dortmund is responsible for a community-oriented municipality.
The municipal procurement of goods and services has an impact on many areas and decides whether climate protection goals are achieved or whether local demand promotes sustainable developments.
At the same time, the local economy must be evaluated according to more criteria than just financial economic key figures, but also include and compare values that balance the social benefits of entrepreneurial action.
Because the communal economy is a step on the way to an economic system that primarily places people at the center.
Local companies should be pioneers and drivers of this.
We will: • check all areas regulated in the procurement regulations for the criteria of comprehensive sustainability and human rights, develop them if necessary and consistently demand their use.
• continue to take into account the concerns of wage loyalty and gender equality.
• pay more attention to regional, ecological and fairly traded products and a higher proportion of vegetarian and vegan products when supplying kindergartens, schools, nursing homes and hospitals.
• work to ensure that the municipal companies draw up social balance sheets and take social-ecological criteria into account in financial reports, and must therefore also measure the contribution to the well-being of our society and encourage changes if necessary.
• take into account participation, co-determination, gender democracy, ecological sustainability, quality of life, ecological foot • to enhance the welcome brochure, include target group-specific vouchers and promotional items from the city, as well as information on club offers and aid offers.
Good working conditions in the administration The city of Dortmund, together with the municipal subsidiaries, is the largest local employer.
However, in some areas, especially in the planning and construction sector or in the social and youth welfare sector, there is a growing shortage of personnel.
By 2035, a proportion of around 40% of the current workforce will retire from the city administration.
We therefore see it as our responsibility to strengthen the city as a good and attractive employer and to counteract the shortage of skilled workers.
To this end, we will: • improve training conditions with more money and favourable trainee accommodation as well as an extended trial phase of the final work area.
• offer more part-time training at the city administration and its subsidiaries.
• in particular, expand projects to promote students with a Hauptschule qualification.
• improve the offer for part-time executives.
• drive forward the flexibilisation of work.

by introducing working time accounts, so that the compatibility of family and work is improved.
• Further expand training opportunities.
• continue to try out creative ideas to recruit workers and skilled workers and, where possible, also rely on people who are changing careers and train them.
• offer good career prospects in the administration for refugees.
• further promote gender equality in the administration, especially in leadership positions.
• offer internal mentoring programmes and networking opportunities together with the Equal Opportunities Office, also for the municipal subsidiaries.
• work towards preventing board members, supervisory boards and management in municipal subsidiaries from being elected in local elections.
• aim for digital file management in all areas of the administration.
• offer further training for employees of the administration if this is necessary due to digitalisation measures.
• use the potential of digital processes to offer all services in several languages.
• to install a multilingual online assistant for citizens' questions (ChatBot) on the city's websites.
• to examine the sensible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in suitable areas, being sensitive to the current geopolitical shifts in order to guarantee data protection and data security and to prevent spying by third countries.
• to invest more in the resilience and cybersecurity of our IT infrastructure, as sensitive data is stored there, the functioning of the city depends on it and the follow-up costs after a cyber attack can be very high.
• to expand our own competencies in the field of IT security.
• to set up our own Mastodon instance, i.e.
an independent short message service, to secure sovereign municipal communication, which should also be used by other municipal institutions and companies.
• to check the effectiveness of our social media use in relation to reaching our target groups (especially young people and fellow citizens of the city) in order to do justice to the city's role model function.
• to consider the known problems of commercial platforms (for example lack of legal compliance, inadequate moderation, difficult legal enforcement, manipulability We are developing Dortmund into a smart city.
The focus is on a future-proof digital infrastructure, free and equal access to the network for all, and the protection of our privacy and personal data, for example through the highest IT security standards.
This enables free action on the net, innovation and fair competition.
• Limit investments with municipal funds to investments in environmentally sustainable and socially just projects and investments in child labor, armaments, human rights violations and environmental destruction.
• Understand the training offer of the city as a contribution against youth unemployment and as an example for other companies.
• Demand the application and compliance with the newly established Public Corporate Governance Code (PCGK) at municipal subsidiaries.
• Increase the provision of live data as open data in order to enable the participation of the city society.
For a digital administration The digitalization of the city administration saves work in the medium term and simplifies and accelerates processes, which optimizes the administrative structures.
As a further option for citizens to reach the administration, it facilitates and simplifies the offers and access for citizens.
Therefore, the digitalization processes that have been started must be continued and further potential • digitize all processes of the city administration and use meaningful interfaces to avoid unnecessary typing • prefer Open-Source software in IT procurement for the city.
• created the position of manager for digital sovereignty.
• joined the international alliance Cities for Digital Rights.
• initiated the withdrawal of the city from X and the use of Mastodon.
• introduced free WLAN in city trains.
Municipal election program 2025 For digital participation Digitalization is a challenge for many citizens.
In order for all people to be able to benefit from the opportunities of the digital city, access, barrier-free access and the comprehensibility of digital offers must be secured.
Therefore we will: • strengthen municipal educational offers for digital competence in order to enable digital sovereignty for all.
• enable digital participation for all people, especially for people with disabilities, older people and non-native speakers, by preventing comprehension problems structurally and individually.
• create discrimination-free administrative offers through barrier-free design and easy language.
• expand the multilingual communication of the city administration and ensure that relevant information and digital services are available in the most frequently spoken languages in • Programmes to promote voluntary digital mentors who work in cooperation with senior centres, youth centres and clubs to support people with low digital competence.
• initiate a project to establish “digital education sponsorships” for senior citizens throughout the city.
For Open-Source Software The digital transformation is a central issue for the future of Dortmund.
IT technologies offer enormous potential for economic and social development.
We see great opportunities, particularly in the area of open-source technologies, i.e.
freely accessible and jointly developed software, for both innovative power and transparency and sustainability in the local economy.
An open-source economy not only promotes free access to technologies, but also strengthens digital sovereignty and cooperation.
That is why we want to establish Dortmund as an Open Source Factory.
This means financially and institutionally supporting the establishment of new open-source communities and the development of open-source products by the Dortmund digital industry, as well as promoting their sustainable use in public administration and thus moving it forward.
We have already created a position for open source and will be drawing up a short-term timetable for the digital infrastructure in for social services), booking systems and reporting of defects (defective lighting, illegal waste accumulation, incorrectly parked vehicles, etc.).
• expand free internet throughout the city centre and district centres, as well as in all public buildings and public transport.
• continue to support the city of Dortmund’s “Smart City Strategy” and place particular emphasis on the bundling of systems, networking of entrepreneurial and scientific resources, participation of civil society and data security, and the provision of data as open data.
• integrate all areas of the Smart City into the Dortmund app.
• when collecting and networking data, prevent the surveillance of citizens and the restriction of their rights.
• take into account the findings from the nationwide Smart City programme from other cities and implement them where appropriate in Dortmund.
• permanently anchor the topic of “Green IT” in the city’s system house working programme and further develop it in the light of new challenges in order to reduce the energy and resource consumption of software and hardware.
• continue to convert the city’s servers to green electricity.
• use the topic of sustainability in digitalisation as a criterion when awarding development projects.
• a municipal AI competence center in Dortmund Municipal Election Program 2025 demand a sovereign city administration.
We will also • start an Open Source initiative for Dortmund in order to promote the use of Open Source software and technologies in municipal institutions and companies, to digitally transform the public sector and local economy and at the same time increase independence from individual manufacturers.
• work together with the publicly owned ZenDiS Center for Digital Sovereignty based in the Ruhr area as a GmbH.
• support local companies and start-ups in the introduction of Open Source solutions by providing information and consulting services that make it easier for companies to use and develop Open Source software.
• establish Open Source as the standard in municipal administration by preferentially using Open Source software solutions in administration and public tenders in order to ensure transparency, sustainability and lower dependence on proprietary systems.
• support Open Source-based innovation centers that serve as hubs for the exchange and development of Open Source software solutions, where developers, companies and research institutions should work together to jointly develop new, innovative technologies.
• promote the creation of an Open Source marketplace for Dortmund, where companies • in Dortmund, we will continue to offer and expand green bonds from the city and its companies as a means of financing climate and environmental protection, and to make further offers available to both citizens and institutional investors, who can actively and transparently participate in the financing of the ecological transformation of Dortmund.
In order to reflect gender equality in financial prioritisation, we will • anchor the principle of gender budgeting in all areas, which states that money spent must benefit both genders equally.
• in selected areas, we will take the lead and fully implement gender budgeting, for example in sport, culture and social infrastructure.
• in other areas, we will create awareness, for example in construction and urban planning.
For transparent financial management with the participation of citizens, we will • provide citizens with an interactive and more transparent presentation of the budget.
• demand an overall concept for the involvement of citizens from the creation of the budget to the handling of the results, with different methods for the selection of citizens (random selection, addressing active citizens and representative groups) being examined and digital participation being made possible.
FINANCE Cities like Dortmund are suffering from a high level of old debts, We welcome the long-awaited solution to the old debts of the state government and urge for a quick implementation with the participation of the Bun - des.
Because the Dortmund budget is only kept safe from budgetary security through clever accounting, which would entail enormous restrictions in the political design of the city.
At the same time, most municipal political ideas that move Dortmund forward cost a lot of money, not least because of the many demands from this program.
Financial resources and an independent budget management are essential to be able to meet the diverse challenges from climate protection to the accommodation of refugees to the preservation of the social infrastructure.
Therefore, we will • pursue a budget policy that keeps us away from budgetary security.
• evaluate the municipal revenues from property tax, business tax, dog tax, packaging tax and other taxes and enforce their collection.
• introduce property tax C for land mobilization.
• continue to advocate for the principle of connection, in which the federal government and the state participate in the additional costs caused by their laws and decrees.
• ensure a further crisis-proof and low-fluctuation business tax revenue through a diverse business landscape.
• advocate • no more city profits from climate-damaging • property tax reform for stable income without overloading.
• A citizens' fund set up, which strengthens the financial power of the city and involves Dortmund residents in profits.
• The interactive budget on the way • Guidelines for sustainable and responsible municipal companies decided.
• The old debt solution will relieve Dortmund's budget.
Municipal Election Programme 2025 Municipal Election Programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNENWe want to enable all people to have self-determined mobility.
To do this, everyone must be able to reach school, work, leisure facilities, friends and family.
Restrictions on this self-determination must be removed – through affordable, barrier-free, seamless and safe mobility.
We want to enable people to choose their preferred means of transport and thus make individual mobility more diverse.
We want to make Dortmund a city in which pedestrian traffic, cycling and public local transport offer a good alternative to car traffic.
Because all road users should finally be treated equally.
By having more mobility stations that allow for a change between all modes of transport, we are moving towards a self-determined transportation revolution.
By reducing travel times, we increase safety in mobility.
Even people who are dependent on cars will benefit from the principle of driving slower and arriving faster.
Our mobility policy will also reduce greenhouse gases, as well as noise and pollution emissions.
Our infrastructure must be increasingly protected from the consequences of climate change, such as heavy rain, and at the same time, it must not place an additional burden on people with heat and pollution.
These aspects must be taken into greater consideration in future road renovations.
Overall, we will achieve a more climate-friendly, healthier and safer mobility.MACHT DORTMUND Municipal Election Program 2025 Fläche / Smart Rhino to connect this new district to public transport, largely without cars in the visible cityscape and to place pedestrian and bicycle traffic in the foreground.
• better connect existing commercial areas to public transport • densify the frequency of buses and trains, especially at night and on weekends, and start U-Bahn service earlier on • We will continue to improve the city-suburban connections of our buses and trains in order to strengthen traffic beyond the city limits.
• We will work on implementing the legal obligation for barrier-free public transport in Dortmund, including more wide and functioning trains, short transfer times and loudspeaker announcements at major bus stops.
• We will expand the H-Bahn as a cohesive network in the area of the university and the technology center as planned, but we will not build any more isolated solutions or routes.
For punctual buses Buses transport thousands of Dortmunders every day on short and long routes through Dortmund.
For us, it is clear: The bus ride must be comfortable.
The bus network must serve the everyday routes of the people.
And the bus must arrive on time!
Therefore, there is no more traffic jams in our Dortmund.
To achieve this, we will: • generally give buses automatic priority at traffic lights (priority switching).
• establish dedicated bus lanes on core routes and, if possible.
• re-plan important traffic routes and establish a cycle and bus lane as well as a 30 km/h speed limit.
• reduce through traffic on important bus routes, for example through circulation concepts.
• create attractive, demand-oriented and efficient services for all districts, for example through the increased use of minibuses.
• supplement the tram network with express bus services between district centres.
• Connecting suburbs with further regional express buses beyond the city limits to the surrounding area and thus, among other things, making commuting easier.
• Continuing to support the electrification of the DSW21 bus fleet and advocating for an ambitious electrification timetable.
PUBLIC TRANSPORT A well-developed public transport system (ÖPNV) enables us to achieve our goal and connects us with our fellow human beings.
It benefits people who want to get to their destination comfortably, without traffic jams and stress – regardless of their financial situation, age or whether they own a car.
For many people, public transport is not a luxury, but a necessity: Families with a tight budget, people without a driver’s license, young people on their way to school or senior citizens who want to remain independent for as long as possible – they all rely on a reliable and affordable local transport system.
A powerful, modern public transport system is a win for everyone.
Fewer cars mean less noise, better air quality and more space in our city.
An attractive local transport system makes life easier, fairer and more climate-friendly.
That is why we are committed Because mobility is a fundamental right – and we ensure that it applies to everyone.
For more buses and trains in Dortmund We will focus the priorities – both in planning and financing – on a well-developed public transport system, in order to make the switch possible for everyone.
Therefore we will • make public transport more reliable and minimize failures.
• further densify the frequency of buses and trains.
• increase investments in the expansion of public transport.
• equip more stops with good lighting and shelter.
• plan the public transport connection from the outset in new neighborhoods (Transit-oriented Development).
• use the proceeds from the sale of STEAG shares for the transport revolution, depending on the results of the planning for the former HSP.
• The implementation of the new innovation line 400 as a new connection of the inner city districts in a 10-minute interval has been decided.
• The connection of the H-Bahn to the U42 (Theodor-Fliedner-Heim) is supported.
• New bus connection from Witten to the university - Municipal election programme 2025 For good connections beyond Dortmund The lives of many Dortmunders do not end at the city limits.
Wherever possible, we therefore want to support the city of Dortmund in its efforts to expand the network and increase the frequency of services, and to provide planning support for this.
Many stages of expansion are already set out in the VRR local transport plan for 2025 and must be implemented.
• To work towards relocating stops where better transfers to local transport in Dortmund or better access to important destinations can be achieved (for example Dortmund Tierpark, Aplerbeck Süd, Barop S) and to use potential for additional access to stops (for example a rear exit at Hörde station).
• To work towards creating more stops on existing S-Bahn and regional train lines to make it easier for more people to board (for example Dortmund-West for S5, RB52, RB53 and RB59; Kronprinzenstraße for S4; Phönix-West and Berghofen for RB53 and RB59 • work to extend or expand existing S-Bahn and regional train lines to connect more boroughs in Dortmund (for example S1 to the east with connections to Brügmannplatz and Spähenfelde).
• work to increase the frequency of regional and S-Bahn trains and, if necessary, strive for a double-track expansion of single-track lines (for example RB43 to Herne; RB53 to Iserlohn).
• support the electrification of remaining diesel lines in the regional train network.
• provide more detailed and comprehensive information about construction sites and replacement transport.
• provide the transport and live data from buses and trains as open data.
For tickets that everyone can afford Public transport is only used if it is affordable.
Through the GREENS' efforts in the federal government, the Deutschlandticket was introduced, which represents a revolution in the pricing of local transport and in overcoming tariff boundaries.
We support the continuation of this ticket.
At the local level, the priority in the next step must be placed on the expansion of infrastructure.
In addition to the Deutschlandticket, we will • work to lower the price of the Deutschlandticket Sozial (currently €48) to €29.
• offer the Deutschlandticket Schule free of charge to all schoolchildren.
• offer more combination tickets for events in urban areas.
For an expanded Stadtbahn network The expansion of Dortmund's Stadtbahn network has come to a standstill since 2008.
This must be changed.
At the same time, there is a need for more barrier-free access, reliable travel times and a higher frequency in the existing network.
• work to expand the Stadtbahn network by a total of at least 25 km by 2035.
• build Stadtbahn lines with their own track bed.
• intensify the construction of existing tram lines that move in regular street traffic with their own track bed, and expand single-track lines as needed to two tracks.
• increase the frequency of service, especially on the sections of U42 and U47 close to the city center, similar to the already approved five-minute interval of the U41 to Hörde starting in the summer.
• pursue the goal that all train stations are accessible to all people, if necessary through provisional solutions.
• examine whether the reintroduction of the tram construction office can lead to an acceleration in the improvement of the tram infrastructure and accessibility.
• purchase enough new trams with sufficient width (2.65 m) for lines U43 and U44 and renovate stations so that double trains can be used everywhere.
For a night network that Dortmund deserves.
Whoever doesn't come home at night doesn't go out – and that hurts Dortmund's nightlife and nighttime citizens.
Only the connection of all districts beyond the daytime hours is appropriate for a big city.
To achieve this, we will: • create a functioning and attractive night network that better connects bus and train and is • work to ensure that DSW21 offers consultation and further education opportunities for staff.
Offer institutional centres and also strive for private institutions.
• Make Park and Ride with combination tickets for parking and train travel more attractive.
• Further adapt pricing to the Germany Ticket, eliminate double structures and digitalise tariff systems in order to utilise cost-saving potential.
For reliable financing In the future, more people should be able to use and want to use public transport.
Therefore, there should be no cuts in services.
Therefore, operating costs must be covered in the coming years.
At the same time, further expansion of public transport is necessary.
In order to ensure financing, we will • direct more DSW21 funds into the operation and expansion of public transport, e.
g.
through savings in the subsidies for the airport.
• revenue from the city's parking garages, street parking spaces and other parking spaces on city or city-owned subsidiary properties to invest in the operation and expansion of public transport.
• continue to work towards the federal government and the state permanently compensating for the loss of revenue due to the Germany Ticket.
• strive for companies and institutions to be able to share the costs of certain lines with their employees, customers and other users, if there is mutual interest, and work towards the state-level regulation of third-party financing.
Bus drivers and control and service personnel have daily contact with customers and not only have to deal with complaints about public transport that they are not responsible for, but are also victims of verbal or physical violence.
However, DSW21 should not lose any personnel to the competition (for example Long-distance transport) and should be able to attract new employees and trainees as a good employer.
Therefore, politics and administration must support DSW21 in coping with the shortage of personnel due to the retirement of the large birth cohorts.
• work towards improving Municipal Election Programme 2025 Cycle routes planned.
Now it is a matter of concluding these plans, quickly clarifying the route of the RS1 and resolutely driving forward implementation.
For this we will • analogous to the road construction offensive, also start a cycle route offensive, in which cycle routes are implemented and crossings are asphalted in red, damaged cycle paths are repaired and new cycle paths are laid.
• expand the cycling infrastructure beyond the cycle routes, without increasing conflicts with pedestrians or ecologically valuable spaces.
• further develop the cycle route network to connect the outer districts with each other through faster radial connections.
• further develop the cycle route network to connect the outer districts with each other through faster, radial connections.
• extend the cycle route network beyond the district centres to the city limits and to connect with inter-communal cycle paths (for example Rheinischer Esel).
• bring the route planning and alternative testing for the Dortmund sections of the Radschnellweg 1 (RS1) to a conclusion and finally build the RS1.
• Establish a continuous and safe cycle route for all on the B1 as a city road.
• Install a “green wave” for cycling in more traffic lights, especially on cycle routes and other main traffic routes.
• Prioritise cycling consistently on the route of cycle routes, especially at junctions with main roads and in parallel to roads with higher car traffic.
• Plan and implement two-way cycle paths on both sides of major main roads.
• Install more green right-turn arrows for cyclists at traffic lights.
• Expand red asphalt cycle paths.
• Work more with pictogram chains to assert the right of way of the road for cycling.
• Further develop our own cycling standards in Dortmund if necessary.
• Create more staff in the administration for the planning of infrastructure measures for cycling.
• Prioritise financial resources in the civil engineering department more strongly for cycling and develop structures for routine implementation of cycling facilities.
• Use necessary construction work such as canal construction work or similar for short-term improvements in cycle infrastructure (“No digging without redesign”).
• Designate more cycle streets and cycle zones, here with traffic-calming measures such as modal filters Our goal is that all people in our city can travel safely and comfortably by bike – whether children on their way to school, seniors on their way to the supermarket or commuters – and at the same time be active and healthy.
Only by improving attractiveness-enhancing factors such as safety, direct connections and secure parking facilities will cycling become a real alternative.
With a well-thought-out infrastructure and clear priorities, we will make Dortmund a real cycling city!
For cycle paths that connect Dortmunders, they should be able to quickly and directly reach their destination by bike.
For this, we need a seamless cycle network with short, direct routes – because the best cycle path should not be longer than the route by car.
We can only increase the proportion of cycling traffic if a safe infrastructure is guaranteed – one that makes everyone feel good about using their bike.
That is why we are focusing on separate cycle lanes on main roads as well as traffic-calming measures in side streets and especially on the Veloroutes, the main axes of the Dortmund cycle network.
Because no one should be afraid of an accident with cars or pedestrians.
In • Cycle paths marked, illuminated and made safer at crossings.
• Removal of barriers at many points.
Municipal Election Programme 2025 • Enabling crossing of the city centre in both north-south and east-west directions without impairing pedestrian traffic.
• Creating conflict-free infrastructure within the Wallring by also enabling attractive through-travel for cyclists in Hansastraße, Kleppingstraße and Kampstraße, analogous to prioritisation of pedestrian traffic in pedestrian zones.
• Marking the crossing points with departing cars more clearly at the B54 (south of the B1) and thus highlighting the potential of a suitable cycle route.
• Launching a city campaign for more mutual consideration in road traffic.
• Improving cycle path signage so that cyclists can travel safely to their destination.
For comprehensive bicycle parking spaces, the bicycle parking facilities must be adapted to the increasing proportion of cycling.
This concerns everyday routes – when shopping, at work, before school and on your own doorstep.
We activate private areas through funding and advice, while we shape • significantly increase the number of bicycle parking facilities in the coming years, including those for cargo bikes and multi-storey facilities.
• not occupy the limited space of pedestrians, but use individual parking spaces.
• plan for further favourable bicycle sheds at suitable junctions and install secure bicycle boxes in the city's car parks.
• provide more charging stations for e-bikes.
• set up and maintain more service stations with air pumps and bicycle workshops.
• increase the necessary number of bicycle parking spaces in the parking space by-law, so that a number of parking spaces adapted to the users is offered during construction work.
• finance more covered bicycle parking facilities at schools, e.
g.
also as a cage.
• set up a programme for the establishment of (covered) bicycle parking facilities on street-side parking spaces in cooperation with the ADFC and expand the offer (e.
g.
For example, through “Bike Hangar”).
• In particular, more octagonal bike sheds in densely populated residential areas, in cooperation with the ADFC, should be financed, organised and implemented by the city, as so far, groups that pay for themselves have to form.
• The city should start a campaign in which one or more speed cushions reduce the proportion of motorised individual traffic and streets without bus and heavy goods traffic are reconstructed to a minimum width of 4.50 m.
• In construction site management, safe cycle path routing should be ensured by prescribing standards for cycling in construction planning and sanctioning construction companies for non-compliance.
For safe cycling To reduce the number of traffic fatalities to zero and thus achieve the European “Vision Zero” in Dortmund, the most important thing in cycling is attractive, physically separate, conflict-free and asphalted infrastructure.
Because in Dortmund, every child should be able to cycle safely to school.
Every Dortmund resident should be able to shape their everyday life with the bike.
Our goal for Dortmund: All roads must be safe for cyclists to use For this we will • no longer set up any more joint foot and cycle paths in the interior and reduce and rebuild existing mixed forms of transport.
• especially take a look at school routes in order to create safe cycle paths for pupils.
• create higher safety through structurally separate cycle paths.
• for this purpose, we will increasingly convert the road space previously used by motorised traffic for cycle traffic, in order to guide cycle traffic on main roads in structurally separate, wide, protected cycle paths and not between flowing and parked motorised traffic (principle: pedestrian zone, structurally separate cycle path, multi-functional strip or parking strip, carriageway).
• make protected intersections or roundabouts according to the Dutch model the standard in new road planning and conversion measures.
• make left-hand turns subjectively and objectively safer, since standing areas with left-hand turn arrows in the middle of the intersection between cars are unsafe and feel unsafe, and direct right-hand turns should be possible independently of the traffic light sequence.
• create more and larger parking spaces for cyclists at existing intersections.
• sensitise the authorities, in particular, to the punishment of parking • maintain the guarded bicycle box on the south side of the main station and initially set up a temporary box on the north side and take it into account in the northern station expansion.
• functionally upgrade the largely unused space in the pedestrian tunnel between Freistuhl and Stadtbahnhaltestelle Hbf as a passable bicycle parking lot.
Municipal election program 2025 whereby the direct residential streets in front of schools are temporarily closed at the beginning and end of school to enable safe travel by bike, on foot or by bus and to encourage parent taxis to use pick-up and drop-off zones.
• quickly implement the concept of sidewalk axes from the Master Plan Mobility in a model project, e.
g.
between the main station and the harbor district.
• bring the “sidewalk network” from the Master Plan Mobility into the concrete implementation planning.
• equip sensible path networks with appropriate signage to link important goals.
• promote the lighting of sidewalks on important axes, e.
g.
with automatic lighting with detection sensors.
• Increase winter maintenance on pedestrian walkways, especially on important axes, at traffic lights and at public transport stops.
• Pay attention to longer green intervals at traffic lights for pedestrians, which also allow for complete crossing within a green phase for people with limited mobility, even at large intersections, for example, at the Wall.
• Adjust traffic light switching, especially in the vicinity of kindergartens and schools, so that two-part traffic lights with central islands receive simultaneous and equally long green phases.
• In construction management, create safe and sufficiently wide pedestrian walkways and as short and efficient detours for pedestrians as possible, and also minimize waiting times at construction site traffic lights.
• Create more pedestrian zones and expand existing pedestrian zones, also in the suburban centers, in order to ensure traffic safety, create a higher quality of stay and strengthen purchasing power.
• Work towards permanently opening the pedestrian walkway at the Westfalenhallen between Lindemannstraße and Stadion, while ensuring a safe passage even during logistical activities.
For the removal of barriers.
For a We are committed to ensuring that barrier-free planning is implemented throughout the city – not just in the traditional sense in public spaces, but also digitally.
To achieve this, we will • introduce a city-wide barrier-free concept that identifies existing obstacles and provides concrete solutions for PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC We are committed to a city in which all people can move around safely and freely – whether on foot, in a wheelchair or with a pram.
A city in which barrier-free access is not a special case, but a matter of course.
A city that puts people at the centre.
The transport revolution also means making pedestrian traffic safer and more attractive.
The design of our streets must take into account the weakest road users, so that everyone feels equally safe.
Our vision is clear: a city in which everyone can reach their destination on foot.
A city that does not exclude anyone.
Through concrete measures, we want to make this vision a reality.
More space for walking It is time for the city to give more attention to pedestrian traffic as part of the necessary transport revolution.
For this, the goal must be to create more safety for pedestrians in every re-planning and new planning of a road.
We orientate ourselves on the weakest traffic participants and create fairness in this way.
• in every re-planning and new planning of roads, create wider sidewalks (at least 2.5 m) and enough safe crossing possibilities.
• in case of doubt, re-sort parking spaces to make it possible for pedestrians to pass, especially in narrow streets in densely populated residential areas.
• in case of doubt, use more physical barriers like bollards or plantings to prevent parking on sidewalks.
• make intersections more pedestrian-friendly, for example, according to the Dutch model, in which the turning possibilities are not only optimized for cars and heavy traffic, but the standing areas for pedestrians are enlarged and the visibility of intersections is improved.
• use more personnel and scan vehicles for stronger controls of wrong parkers, especially on sidewalks or in other areas that obstruct pedestrians.
• no longer accept common foot and bike paths in the urban area.
• divide the office of the pedestrian and cycling traffic commissioner into two positions and thus hire a municipal pedestrian traffic commissioner.
• prioritize looking at school routes and continue the project “So läuft das!” and expand it to all school types in order to promote the self-determined, safe and sustainable mobility of children and young people.
• establish the concept of “school streets” at as many schools as possible, especially at primary schools, the municipal election program 2025 proposes improvements, contains an action guide for all departments and authorities as well as binding standards for route guidance, construction sites, bus stops, etc.
• involve those who are impaired in their mobility, vision, language or hearing.
• demand that the point “contribution to barrier-free access” is a permanent component of every building plan, zoning plan and other committee proposals.
• check the digital barrier-free access on the municipal websites in order to be able to offer information, entertainment and services digitally in a barrier-free manner.
• install ground-level guidance systems at public transport stops, important path connections and in pedestrian zones.
• install barrier • We will continue to consistently maintain the prevention of the construction of the extended OWIIIa/Brackeler Straße in the direction of Unna.
• We will not implement the Nordspange as a continuous truck route beyond the Bornstraße to the Emscherallee and will only implement the eastern section of the “Hoesch-Allee” as the development of the Westfalenhütte, if possible, with only two lanes.
• We will convert the B1 into a city street for all Dortmund residents by diverting through traffic and regional traffic to the A2 and A1 and by dividing the existing space for fair use by all road users, as we see the B1 (Rheinlanddamm and Westfalendamm) as a central, historically significant axis in Dortmund.
• We will bundle the traffic flows of motorized traffic through circulation concepts.
• We will reduce the proportion of motorized individual traffic through traffic-calming measures such as modal filters and speed bumps in order to calm traffic in the city districts and prevent unwanted through traffic.
• We will consistently pursue traffic violations in order to increase the safety of all road users.
• In a publicity campaign We want to raise awareness of the fact that cars are left unused in public spaces for the majority of the time.
Since this public space belongs to everyone, we have finally managed to increase parking fees, which had been low for years.
We want the value of public space to be reflected in parking fees: parking in public spaces should cost significantly more than parking in a parking garage.
In principle, we want to invest revenue from parking fees and parking violations in the expansion of public transport and cycling infrastructure.
To solve the parking problem and ensure fair distribution of parking spaces, we want to promote a transportation revolution that benefits all road users, as it will increase safety for everyone.
At the same time, those who are dependent on cars will benefit from improved traffic conditions and less congestion if more people use public transport, cycle or walk.
If traffic is better distributed among all modes of transport, there will be fewer conflicts of use in limited space.
In this sense, we understand a road to be more than just a lane for cars.
Roads are living spaces for all people on their daily journeys – on foot, by bike, by bus, by train This requires a road infrastructure that avoids conflicts and is distributed fairly – this also applies to parking spaces.
For more independence from the car, we will achieve this by: • distributing road space more fairly.
• only giving motorised individual transport the space it really needs, which means that wide roads will be questioned and bend radii will no longer be oversized, which can be achieved in the existing infrastructure through a road-shrinking programme.
• generally avoiding new road construction that goes beyond the direct access to new settlements and prioritising the renovation of existing roads.
• not planning any new bypasses that cause noise pollution.
• expanding resident parking zones.
• converting car parking spaces into public spaces, thereby strengthening the hospitality and urban environment.
• preventing new road construction with new gaps (OWIIIa through the Wickeder Holz, Pleckenbrink- • 24 new positions and parking sensors against wrong parking.
• purchasing speed camera trailers.
• adjusting parking fees in the city centre.
• Tempo 30 expanded.
Municipal election programme 2025 • the management of parking spaces and the establishment of residential parking zones in the inner city districts and suburban areas to be expanded throughout.
• the costs for resident parking permits to be raised overall and to be staggered according to the size of the cars, in order to fairly distribute public space.
• the parking fees in public space to be fairly priced and thus to promote parking in existing underground car parks and multi-storey car parks and to enable the construction of neighbourhood car parks.
• the parking fees to be raised moderately in the long term, in order to create a stronger incentive for the use of public transport, bicycles or footpaths, especially for short distances.
• a pilot project to be set up soon to build a municipal neighbourhood car park in a suitable, densely populated neighbourhood in the inner city and to issue prepaid parking permits for the residents.
• at the same time, to reduce the number of parking spaces in public space in the immediate vicinity and to work out the redesign of the street space with the participation of the local residents, • Expand park-and-ride offers at light rail stops in the outskirts.
• Expand traffic monitoring with more personnel and digital methods.
• Use parking sensors at critical points so that traffic monitoring can act quickly.
• Make it more comfortable to park without an account at the service portal.
• Promote staff increases and digital upgrades not only in traffic monitoring but also in the fine collection office.
• Provide an area for towed vehicles so that in the future, towed vehicles can only be released with a cash payment.
• Advocate for legal conditions that allow the use of scanning vehicles.
• Consistently enforce parking violations, especially at large events.
• Develop effective parking concepts for large events in the Westfalenhallen or Westfalenpark that relieve the surrounding residents and prevent the blocking of emergency routes.
• In cooperation with BVB, address the extreme parking problem on game days, for example through temporary closures, digital recording of the origin.
• use the parking spaces at the university in conjunction with a shuttle service even at major events in the Westfalenhallen and in the Westfalenpark, similar to BVB games.
• first evaluate the multiple use of existing parking spaces for any new parking problems.
For Tempo 30 We would like to strengthen the tried and tested traffic concept “Drive slower, arrive faster” in Dortmund.
Behind this is the idea that the reduction in speed brings something to all users of the traffic.
The better traffic flow through Tempo 30 and the one-lane redesign of the streets compensates for the loss of time due to the lower speed, which is marginal in the urban area anyway due to the constant stop and go.
This is because the reduction of traffic lights can also be associated with this.
These measures ensure a road infrastructure that ensures appropriate speeds (“Design Speed”).
In a very general sense, a lower speed leads to increased traffic safety for all, to reduced noise and pollutant emissions, to a lower CO2 output, to better air quality, especially in the summer, and to fewer acc For these reasons, we will: • in principle, exhaust the municipal possibilities to introduce a 30 km/h speed limit as the maximum speed in the city centre.
• in the process, we will expand temporary speed limit areas to permanent speed limit areas, especially on school routes that extend beyond the road directly in front of the school.
• we will also relieve the Wall of traffic by introducing a 30 km/h speed limit during the day.
• we will also enforce the reduced speed limit through increased controls, including additional city speed cameras.
• we will not support measures in the planning of roads that invite high speeds, such as wide roads, straight “acceleration lanes” and large curves.
• we will also promote further measures to prevent car racing, which endangers human lives and causes enormous noise pollution.
• we will do this by setting up speed cameras, expanding traffic light sequences with hindering red phases and supporting a solution in the planned reconstruction of the Wall that prevents driving in circles and also reduces posing.
Municipal Election Programme 2025 For Clean E-Mobility Although electromobility does not represent a solution to the comprehensive challeng Therefore we will • set up more charging stations for electric cars at hubs such as park-and-ride car parks and build more NOx blocks (green lampposts) in residential areas and set up more reserved parking spaces for electric cars to make it easier for people without their own homes to switch to electric cars.
• improve the charging infrastructure in car parks.
• equip all charging stations with a connection for charging e-bikes if possible.
• promote charging infrastructure in retail car parks.
• campaign for more charging options at employers in Dortmund by initiating and promoting the “Employers charge up” initiative in Dortmund to provide more charging options for employees at companies.
• increase the proportion of electric cars in the municipal vehicle fleet.
For streets that belong to the people Our goal is a city with attractive and safe places with a high quality of stay.
To achieve this, it is necessary to give parked and driving cars less space to create more space for people.
This also mitigates the consequences of the heating of residential areas through more greening and fewer pollutants.
• understand the central streets in neighbourhood centres as living and • in residential areas, reduce through traffic at intersections with bollards and introduce more one-way streets.
• make the inner city within the ring road largely free of car traffic in order to enable customers of the shops and users of the inner city to have a pleasant and safe stay, and to restrict parking to underground car parks and expand pedestrian zones.
• also make the district centres more attractive by reducing car traffic.
• support car-sharing providers who want to become active in Dortmund in their implementation.
• also offer electric cars through charging facilities.
• prioritise station-based systems, but also offer free-floating providers the opportunity to bring their offer to Dortmund.
For E-scooters with a concept: In addition to cycling, we see the E-scooters introduced a few years ago as an established component of micromobility and we want to hold on to this.
However, this requires some significant adjustments.
Therefore, we will: • strive to no longer allow free floating, but to build up a close network of defined and non-obstructive parking stations that apply to all providers.
• combine the parking • in the urban area, a maximum distance of 500 m for car-sharing stations and 200 m for e-scooter and metropolitan bike stations • consistently hold providers responsible for incorrectly parked scooters and vandalism and impose penalties • ensure that providers only offer e-scooters with interchangeable batteries in order to reduce environmental pollution • if possible and in consultation with providers, in the future, allow e-scooters to be charged at fixed parking locations.
SHARED MOBILITY OFFER Shared mobility offers a simple way to improve self-determined mobility.
With sharing offers, everyone can increase the number of vehicles they use without having to buy a bike, car or e-scooter themselves.
These offers must be expanded in order to reduce dependence on private cars and also increase the use of public transport through sensible combination options in multi-modal travel chains.
Bikesharing, carsharing and e-scooters are thus part of the transport revolution.
For bikesharing everywhere Bikesharing offers a sensible addition to public transport as part of micromobility • Lastenrad rental and metropolradRuhr - • Carsharing parking spaces set up throughout the city.
Municipal election program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND can be financed from the airport's own profitability.
• not support any renovation measures that result in an increase in the number of passengers.
• work to ensure that the employees of the airport are once again bound by collective agreements, by binding the outsourced service company to collective agreements.
For the end of Dortmund Airport The operation of Dortmund Airport is neither economically nor socially nor environmentally sensible.
Closing the airport offers the opportunity to return a large area to the city, which is ready for ecologically valuable and sustainable new development.
Therefore we will: • strive for the long-term winding down and closure of the airport.
• discuss the possibilities for redevelopment in a variety of ways, publicly and with broad participation, and finally incorporate them into the planning.
AIRPORT The existence of Dortmund Airport is not profitable for the region or for Dortmund.
Companies that benefit from Thus, between 2000 and 2020, the airport was subsidized with more than 300 million euros by DSW21.
Not least, the effects on the climate crisis are also a factor, even if a closure in many areas would only mean a relocation to the regionally significant airports such as Düsseldorf and Cologne-Bonn.
However, air traffic also has ecological consequences for Dortmund, which must be reduced by preventing increased passenger numbers and a long-term closure of the airport.
For an honest approach to the airport, the airport in Dortmund is a burden on the residents in the flight path.
At the same time, it is superfluous due to Dortmund's good connection to significantly more regionally important airports.
In the past decades, the airport has been subsidized with funds from DSW21 in the three-digit million range - funds that DSW21 could have used more sensibly in the expansion of public transport.
Therefore, we will • no longer accept the financing of the airport by DSW21 at the expense of other corporate areas, for example bus and train.
• • Developed scenarios for the airport site.
Municipal election program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNENA city is more than streets and houses – it is the home of people with their dreams, worries and stories.
Over 600,000 people live in Dortmund, and each of them has the right to protection, participation and a life in dignity.
But the reality often looks different: Poverty excludes, barriers restrict, discrimination hurts and political processes remain closed to many.
We do not accept this.
We fight for a Dortmund that is oriented towards the needs of those who are often overlooked.
For a city that not only talks about justice, but lives it – in every kindergarten, in every office, in every district.
Social security must not be a matter of chance, but a reliable promise: No one should have to live homeless, hungry or excluded in Dortmund.
No one should be disadvantaged due to their origin, gender, disability or economic situation.
No one should feel invisible.
We stand for a city in which children can grow up free of poverty, families can find support and young people can be taken seriously and make decisions about their future.
For a healthcare system that leaves no one behind.
For cultural spaces that are open to everyone.
For sports that bring people together.
For schools that can create opportunities.
And for a democracy in which everyone is heard – not just the loudest.
At the same time, we know: a just city is not a state, but a joint task.
It is created where people stand up for each other, question structures and take new paths.
Diversity is not a challenge, but our greatest strength.
It makes Dortmund lively, creative and sustainable.
All of this can only be achieved together – with the people, clubs, organisations and initiatives that make our city strong every day with their commitment.MACHT DORTMUND Municipal Election Programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUNDWe must never look away and no one should be forced to sleep on the streets, but should receive accommodation, protection, help and prospects.
Social security also includes a humane drug policy for us.
We reject a policy of displacement and criminalisation and instead focus on health care, prevention, advice and safe spaces.
Our goal is a Dortmund that leaves no one behind – a city that offers protection, prospects and participation to all people.
For a city that fights poverty We are one of the richest societies in the world and yet many people in Dortmund still live in poverty.
Poverty means more than just financial need.
It restricts participation opportunities, endangers health and ruins future prospects – especially for children.
Because every third child in Dortmund lives in poverty or is threatened by poverty.
The previous measures to combat poverty are not enough.
We want to tackle poverty at its roots and not just its symptoms.
We are fighting for a society in which all people can lead a dignified life and no one is left behind.
Social security is a fundamental right and the basis for real participation in social life.
We want to align the politics in our city with this.
• Counteract child poverty by improving early childhood support and expanding care offers, especially in disadvantaged districts, and by creating free sports offers and supporting the necessary equipment.
• Create more equal opportunities in the educational offer by treating unequal things unequally and by bundling funds and resources more effectively in kindergartens and schools where they are most urgently needed in order to more effectively prevent child poverty.
• Reduce the effects of child poverty in school through a free daily meal and the expansion of the social index-based comprehensive school day.
• Specially commit ourselves to fighting against old-age poverty, especially among women, by expanding childcare places and removing barriers that prevent women from working full-time.
• Make the social welfare office more efficient and thereby expand its capacities in order to shorten waiting times for social benefits and It restricts life in all areas: education, health, housing, participation in social life.
It affects children, single parents, unemployed people, people with disabilities, senior citizens, refugees and many more, often invisibly and yet right in the middle of us.
We want social security to be understood not as an exception, but as a fundamental right.
Every person in Dortmund should be able to live in dignity, regardless of their origin, gender, age or residence status.
That is why we are committed to comprehensive poverty reduction that tackles the causes at a structural level.
This includes fair wages, good working conditions and affordable housing as well as better counselling and support services.
We want to improve opportunities for children, reduce educational inequalities and strengthen support systems.
Poverty in old age, especially among women, must not be a societal norm.
A special focus is on the prevention of homelessness.
Because the loss of housing is often avoidable if support is provided in good time.
At the same time, we are fighting for a humane approach to homeless people.
In recent years, there have been too many deaths in Dortmund.
This must not happen again.
• Dortmund map with more opportunities for more people.
• Housing First finally introduced.
• Extensive financial support for welfare associations and social carriers.
• The goal of overcoming homelessness by 2030 decided and an action plan against homelessness initiated.
• The current drug consumption room first expanded and then saved, and the establishment of further consumption locations initiated.
• Strengthening of the street work offers for men in precarious living situations.
• The new health house at the Gast-Haus un • Bahnhofsmission supported.
• Telephone counseling and social prevention ge - Municipal election program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUNDKnowledge as well as targeted further training.
• create individual job and qualification offers for refugees within the framework of federal legislation.
• expand the support of the job center for integration into the primary labor market.
• action offices of the job center and similar institutions • reduce age discrimination in the labor market by strengthening cooperation between the city, businesses, chambers of commerce and local actors in order to promote age-appropriate hiring procedures, offer further training for those over 50 and organize special job fairs or online portals for older job seekers.
• strengthen age-mixed teams in municipal companies and support the representation of older employees through cooperation with trade unions, senior councils and social institutions.
For a humane drug policy The Dortmund drug policy should respect human dignity.
We reject the stigmatization, criminalization, exclusion and expulsion of drug-addicted people.
In contrast, the focus of GREEN politics is a drug policy based on prevention, concrete help for drug-addicted people, decriminalization and scientific findings.
We consider the Zurich model as a role model and rely on prevention, early detection and early intervention as well as on therapies to accompany We are working to mitigate the damage to those affected by providing consumption spaces, drug checking, health care and outreach social work.
Repression is not imposed on drug addicts, but in connection with organized crime.
• Prevention through educational offers and sensitization, among other things in schools, and measures for early recognition and early intervention.
• Offer drug help in places that are visited by those affected or that are accessible.
• Maintain the current drug consumption space location and expand it with a second consumption space close to the center and further expand the opening hours.
• Supplement these offers with smaller, decentralized consumption spaces and thus create drug help at the places where the affected people spend their time.
• Also create a drug consumption space as a safe space for women, also for violence prevention and special • work with DSW21 and VRR to ensure that driving without a valid ticket is no longer prosecuted as a criminal offense.
• Expand the offer of discounts through the Dortmund Card and achieve faster and automated delivery and dispatch of the Dortmund Card wherever possible.
• We will work towards good communication of social benefits and services, so that all people in Dortmund are informed about their entitlements, benefits and additional services.
Employment instead of exclusion.
Employment means more than just earning a living.
It provides structure, meaning and social participation.
We stand for a labour market policy that puts people at the centre and leaves no one behind.
In a changing world of work, we want to offer security and at the same time open up new perspectives.
Too many people are still excluded from the labour market – whether due to disabilities, language barriers, reduced earning capacity, illness, age discrimination or lack of (formal) qualifications.
We want to break down barriers and see diversity as a strength.
We want to guarantee a decent income for all, adapting support systems to people’s living realities and providing support to take up employment.
• Support the implementation and expansion of the municipal labour market strategy 2030, in order to reduce the unemployment rate to below 8% in the long term.
• Reduce youth unemployment to a minimum.
• Support and expand projects that support young people in the transition from school • Create offers that cover training costs in special cases.
• Strengthen the training support of economic development.
• Expand counseling and qualification offers for the unemployed in order to recognize potentials more effectively and promote them.
• In cooperation with the employment agency, expand measures for the reintegration of long-term unemployed into the labor market and pursue the goal of more attractive compensation.
• Support projects and initiatives that offer opportunities for long-term unemployed that are oriented towards the needs of the participants.
• Strengthen further training opportunities for long-term unemployed that provide both basic vocational knowledge and digital skills.
• Ensure that recipients of corresponding transfer payments have adequate housing costs.
• Provide additional municipal funds for the assumption of rental arrears to prevent forced evictions.
• Offer additional emergency sleeping accommodations for people between 18 and 21 years of age.
Dignity instead of distress Homelessness and the lack of housing are not the result of individual failures, but the result of social inequality, the housing shortage and the lack of social security.
People who live Therefore we will not accept: • the displacement of homeless people from the cityscape through bans or architecture that is hostile to humans (for example Anti-homeless benches).
• fines for homeless people for camping and sleeping in public spaces, as well as for sleeping on park benches (so-called secondary use of seating furniture).
• low-threshold emergency aid programs with a focus on medical care, chronic and psychological problems and existential support.
• free, public and 24-hour toilets.
• strengthening outreach social work with more street workers, especially in the districts.
• making emergency sleeping places humane for everyone and especially ending the allocation to purely profit-oriented providers (such as European Homecare) and transferring them to municipal or non-profit providers.
• adequate overnight accommodation for young people, young adults, women, elderly and care-dependent people, drug users and psychiatric patients, which cover their special needs.
• independent complaint options in communal accommodation.
• Provide emergency accommodation to all involuntarily homeless people in a low-threshold and free manner.
• Establish additional daytime accommodation.
• Expand accommodation options with dog places.
• Expand barrier-free facilities in facilities.
Be able to address aid offers for women.
• Also permanently abolish proof of residence.
• Expand the offer of vending machines to prevent illnesses caused by contaminated drug paraphernalia.
• Establish a diamorphine ambulance as a supplement to the aid offer.
• Create more counseling places for addiction medicine and psychiatric care, for psychosocial counseling and for inpatient treatment.
• Strengthen the media competence of young people so that they can critically question advertising for alcohol and other legal drugs.
• Exclude advertising for drugs such as alcohol and nicotine from urban advertising spaces.
• Monitoring and drug checking (free and non-punishable testing of drugs by drug help to avoid overdoses and identify harmful substances) to always have an up-to-date picture of the quantitative presence of substances.
Housing instead of homelessness Homelessness often starts slowly and can affect anyone.
Rent arrears, job loss, separation, domestic violence against women or illness – the causes are manifold.
The paths into homelessness could often be avoided by a special state or municipal safety net.
We Greens are committed to preventing homelessness, strengthening social security and helping those affected quickly and without red tape.
Our goal is a city in which no one has to live without a decent home.
We want to pursue this goal in Dortmund as well, in line with the EU’s goal of overcoming homelessness by 2030.
• Strengthening the “Housing First” approach, in which people are given a home without preconditions, which has already been introduced in Dortmund on a Green initiative.
• Strengthening municipal and non-profit housing construction, especially for the construction of social housing.
• Pre • expand municipal advice centres for people with rent arrears or in financial difficulties.
• strengthen contacts between housing companies and the social welfare office to prevent loss of housing.
• conduct a multilingual information campaign to make people aware of the help on offer.
• support the transition from accommodation in women's shelters to their own homes.
Municipal Election Programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND• offer other formats with advice services in addition to established emergency sleeping places and establish them if necessary, e.
g.
Tiny Houses or low-threshold accommodation containers.
• expand the municipal reserve housing in particular to include small living units.
• establish a city-funded warmth bus for the winter months, which offers a place to warm up, hot food and hygiene facilities – and which, as a heat bus for the summer months, provides protection from heat, drinking water and cool places to stay.
• establish an emergency aid programme for extreme weather conditions.
• financially support voluntary help offers.
• Establish more outlets for debt counselling, addiction counselling and social counselling, and in particular close the gap in open social counselling.
• Sensitise law enforcement officers to a humane approach to homeless and housing-insecure people.
While acute help is important, it is not enough to sustainably combat homelessness.
Once someone ends up on the street, they often have great difficulty getting back into a stable life.
On the initiative of the Greens, the city of Dortmund has set itself the goal of overcoming homelessness by 2030, based on the goals of the EU and the federal government.
We are committed to ensuring that homeless people receive long-term support – with affordable housing, social support and career prospects.
Our goal is to prevent homelessness not only in the short term, but structurally.
• Drive forward the development and implementation of the local action plan to overcome homelessness.
• Create more subsidised and affordable housing in Dortmund.
• Accompany the implementation of the “Housing First” concept with qualified support services and thus enable long-term prevention of homelessness • more transitional housing with social-pedagogical support to facilitate the transition to independent living.
• more vocational re-entry programs and qualification offers for homeless people.
• create protected jobs and employment opportunities for homeless people.
• stronger support for qualification and retraining programs.
• improve support services for women and children in the women's shelter and offer sustainable youth welfare programs after their stay.
• support the transition from accommodation in the women's shelter to their own homes.
• strongly expand educational work in schools and other educational institutions for violence prevention and clarification.
• intensify work with perpetrators of domestic violence, especially with the project "Real Men Talk".
• implement the national legal right to protection and assistance for victims of violence.
• enable trace evidence collection after sexual abuse in all Dortmund clinics, regardless of whether a report has been filed.
• expand multilingual counseling services and psychosocial support.
• establish a "House of Women's Rights" in which the women's advice center, the commission for crime prevention and victim protection of the Dortmund police, and the public prosecutor's office responsible for domestic violence Dortmund has a responsibility to ensure social justice, participation and protection for people in very different life situations.
This includes women, who are still structurally disadvantaged, as well as refugees, older people, people with disabilities or sex workers.
We want Dortmund to be a city where no one is forgotten.
We are committed to this – for real equality, for barrier-free living, for more protection against violence and exploitation and for support in old age or when starting a new life in a foreign country.
The local authority is often the first place where people seek help, justice or protection.
That is why we need concrete local measures that improve structures, create access and provide opportunities.
We promote support services for vulnerable groups, campaign for fair working conditions, even in marginalised areas of life, and strengthen voluntary work as the backbone of a solidary city.
Dortmund should be a city where equality is not just a promise, but a reality.
A city that does not tolerate poverty in old age, loneliness, housing shortages and discrimination, but instead meets them with clever, forward-looking politics.
A city that listens, lets people participate and does not leave anyone behind.
A city that belongs to everyone.
For the equality of women Gender equality is a fundamental pillar of our democratic society.
Despite some progress, women still experience structural disadvantages in almost all areas of life.
In addition, at least one third of all women living in Germany experience physical, psychological or sexualized violence.
The fact that a femicide occurs almost every day is a social and political scandal.
We want all people in Dortmund to be able to live freely, safely and equally regardless of gender.
On the initiative of the Greens, a coordination office for the municipal implementation of the Istanbul Convention was established in Dortmund, which is intended to improve the protection of women against violence in Dortmund.
• quickly implement the municipal master plan for the implementation of the Istanbul Convention in order to effectively protect women against violence.
• Places in the Dortmund women's shelter should be built according to need, so that all women can be protected as best as possible, and the work of the Dortmund women's shelter should be supported by expanded funding.
• The Istanbul Convention should be implemented at the municipal level.
• Anonymous trace evidence for victims of sexual violence should be implemented.
• Funding for the women's shelter should be increased.
• Public campaigns "No means No" and "Don't call me a doll" should be implemented.
• Parity should be established for municipal prices and honors.
• A women's entrepreneur award should be introduced.
• Childcare should be established for council meetings, so that parents can also participate politically.
• The Migrant Women's Association should be supported.
• A campaign against stereotypical career choices.
• The Competence Center for Women and Work should be established.
• Girls in pure team sports should be promoted.
Municipal Election Program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND• Community Health Nurses should be introduced to improve the well-being and health care of • Provide stronger support for senior citizens when applying for housing benefits and basic security.
• Promote participation projects to combat loneliness in old age (for example The “NachbarBude” project in the north).
• Create programmes that enable senior citizens to participate in digital life and to use digital services to the fullest extent.
• Continue the “Gesundheitskiosk” model project beyond 2026.
• Strengthen offers that facilitate access to voluntary work for older people.
For lived inclusion In a just society, every person has the right to equal participation – regardless of physical or mental abilities, origin, age or social situation.
Inclusion is not an abstract concept for us, but a concrete vision: We want a community in which diversity is experienced as an enrichment and barriers are consistently removed.
We are committed to this with determination.

For voluntary work as the heart of the city In Dortmund, thousands of people are voluntarily active in clubs and initiatives to help others and make our city a better place to live.

For good care for all In our city, there are major differences in how well people are medically cared for.

Therefore, we will • demand more health insurance seats for pediatricians and actively promote their establishment, especially in neighborhoods with high demand, such as Nordstadt.

• support the Clearingstelle Gesundheit, which helps, especially EU In emergency care, at the GP, in public spaces and in healthcare, many people in Dortmund experience on a daily basis whether the care is working.
Medical services that are accessible and affordable for everyone must not be a privilege.
They must be available to everyone, regardless of where they live, their income, their background, their age or their gender.
We are committed to a health policy that also strengthens people's living conditions.
A healthy city needs accessible practices, fair working conditions, safe maternity wards, prevention services for all age groups and genders and a strong municipal hospital.
It protects against loneliness, creates green and movement-friendly spaces, enables healthy nutrition, eliminates barriers and thus combats social differences in care.
Dortmund must fulfil its responsibility to ensure a stable hospital structure and good medical care in every district.
In particular, more services must also strengthen mental health.
Our goal is a Dortmund in which everyone can live, grow up and grow old in good health.
We want to implement measures that improve everyday life, make structures fairer and understand health as a common task.
For a hospital landscape that helps everyone, hospitals make a significant contribution to the health care of the people of Dortmund.
We are committed to the preservation of all hospitals in Dortmund with their individual focuses in the sense of hospital planning.
The Klinikum Dortmund is a special guarantor for the health of our city as a municipal hospital of maximum care.
The Klinikum provides medical top performance for all people of Dortmund and far beyond the city limits.
What counts here is the low-threshold health kiosk created in the Nordstadt.
The Klinikum Dortmund has invested in the creation of the prevention department for cannabis.

For example, The offers for abortions have decreased strongly in the last years.
We want to take into account the needs of all genders in the health system, especially those who are currently neglected.
Therefore we will • fight for safe possibilities for abortions in Dortmund, and also take the responsibility for the Klinikum Dortmund.
• support the possibility of free, anonymous and non-reportable DNA evidence in the clinic, which offers the possibility to secure evidence after sexual violence like a rape, without directly filing a report.

• examine the creation of a Women’s Health Centre after the model of Heidelberg, in which an association offers a low-threshold contact and counselling centre for girls, women and their relatives on female-specific health topics and psychological or psychosocial topics with municipal funds.
For psychological health and the fight against loneliness We stand for a healthy city.
This includes the inclusion of psychological health in addition to physical health.
All citizens should have access to the advice and treatment they need.
Mental health care is not good enough in many places, which is why the offer of psychosocial counselling and crisis intervention must also be expanded by the city.
We need more places where people with mental illnesses and their relatives can exchange their experiences.
We need measures to de-stigmatize and more offers to enable mental health.
• ensure better air quality and noise protection at all levels by promoting alternative mobility for a better air quality.
• implement healthy and livable neighbourhoods as a goal of urban planning, which offers good living conditions for everyone.
For healthy nutrition Good food is an important building block for a healthy life.
However, many people in Dortmund have to pay more attention to the price than to the quality when it comes to food.
To change this, we will • promote projects such as “Breakfast for all”, which enables children to have a healthy breakfast.
• promote regional food networks such as the “Dortmund and Region Food Council” and strive for closer cooperation with the administration.

We want every child in Dortmund to have access to high-quality care.
We place particular value on a non-discriminatory access to all nurseries, regardless of where they live, their background or religion.
In doing so, we rely on flexible concepts that meet the different needs of families.
In order to improve the diverse range of childcare services, we will: • work with the state to improve the childcare ratio in the U3 and Ü3 age groups.
• continue to offer training opportunities for educational professionals that are promoted by the municipality and are geared towards new developments.
• create inclusive childcare concepts so that all children can learn and play together.

CHILDREN AND FAMILIES Children, young people and young adults are the future of our city.
Their needs and well-being are a focus of our policy.
Dortmund should become a city in which all young people can grow up, develop freely and fully exploit their potentials, as well as use good participation opportunities in the development of our city.
Sufficient care offers.
Early childhood education lays the foundation for the future of our children and society.
That is why we want to significantly expand and improve the Kita offer in Dortmund.
Because Kitas are much more than just care facilities - they are the first educational institutions in a child's life and are therefore of central importance for equal opportunities.
Here, important foundations are laid for social behavior, language and cognitive abilities.
Kitas are places of education, encounter and promotion, in order to give children good starting opportunities.
We stand for access to reliable, high-quality and local childcare for all families in Dortmund.
Since 2020, 18 new day care centers have been created and the number of care places has been expanded by around 1,800.
But that is not enough.
Our goal is a day care place for every child who wants one.
Until then, child day care will remain an important and necessary form of care.
Therefore, we will • continue to expand the number of care places for children under and over three years of age, especially in underserved districts.
• Provide free child care for more families with low incomes.
• Financially strengthen care before and after Kita opening hours.
• Support new forest and farm Kitas.
• Create safe play opportunities on car-free pop-up play streets for children.

• Establish coordinated transition management between day care centres and schools.
A child-friendly city is a place where children can develop freely, move safely and actively discover their environment.
Our children need space to play, play and discover.
But in many neighbourhoods, attractive play areas and safe routes are lacking.
We want to change this and advocate for more child-friendly open spaces.
Specifically, we will: • Review Council decisions for child-friendliness.
• Pursue the concept of the “playable city” and promote innovative concepts such as “playable street furniture” and work towards more temporary play streets in all districts.
• Create more large and attractive playgrounds that are regularly maintained and cleaned.
• Lower financial barriers for children and enable free admission to swimming pools or the Westfalenpark.

• Support the integration of the principles of “Education for Sustainable Development” (ESD) into the pedagogical work of day care centers.
• Even more kitchens in day care centers to promote healthy eating and the involvement of children in the preparation.
For sufficient care personnel It is crucial that a day care center is available near the place of residence for every child and that no day care center has to close at short notice due to a lack of personnel.
We want to start a skilled labor offensive.
Specifically, we will • Promote the attractiveness of the Dortmund training location • increase the proportion of male educators through targeted advertising • expand practical training.
• promote participation and early support in family and social challenges through social work in daycare centers and establish permanent positions in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Strong families bear responsibility for each other every day and make an important contribution to our society, which is why they deserve the best possible framework conditions.
Family is where responsibility for each other is taken on.
Families are as diverse as our society itself.
We want to support and value all family forms – single parents with children, patchwork families, same-sex or trans* parents, care communities or the nuclear family.
Specifically, we will: • create a family-friendly city with affordable housing and youth facilities.
• consistently involve young people in the design of their neighborhoods.
• introduce digital children's and youth city plans that clearly show offers for children and young people in the neighborhood and at the same time offer the opportunity to contribute ideas and needs in order to make children and young people an early part of modern democratic urban planning.

For support that arrives The mental health of young people is a task for society as a whole.
We want to support young people in going through life resiliently and confidently.
This requires low-threshold offers and competent contact persons.
For a sufficient support offer for young people, we will • increasingly focus on low-threshold offers for children and young people at the places where they spend time.
• expand outpatient and preventive care to adapt it to the needs.
• in particular, use free, anonymous and available online counseling services for young people in crisis situations.

• support and further expand the city-wide street work concept to better support young people at risk.
• adopt a dialogue-based approach to the practical resolution of youth issues.
Youth is our future.
Young people have innovative ideas, fresh perspectives and the courage to initiate change.
However, since they are not yet allowed to vote and only make up a small percentage of our ageing society, they are far too rarely heard and politics are often made without regard to their interests.
They deserve our solidarity and our attention when it comes to their issues.
For us, the Greens, it is clear that we want to hear the voices of young people in Dortmund more strongly, promote their active participation in shaping our city and enable them to co-create their city in a self-determined way.
For the participation of young people We, the Greens, are committed to ensuring that young people in Dortmund can have a say and participate in all decisions that affect them.
Whether in school, in clubs or in town planning – the perspectives of young Young people know their needs best, which is why they are experts in their own right.
We do not want to shape Dortmund for children and young people, but with them.

Education is the key to equal opportunities and social participation.

Good equipment and healthy food.
Our schools are more than just places of learning – they are living spaces in which children and young people spend a large part of their time.

For digital schools with a future Digitalization is fundamentally changing our society.
In order to best prepare children and young people for the challenges of the future, we must also use the opportunities of digitalization in our schools.
We GREENS are committed to modern, future-oriented education that promotes digital competence and at the same time imparts media literacy.
We want children and young people to grow up to be competent citizens in the digital world.
This also includes an understanding of the opportunities and risks of new technologies.

Democracy from the first grade onwards Our schools are more than just places of learning – they are a place of our democracy.
Here young people learn not only facts, but also how to discuss with one another, find compromises and take responsibility.
In Dortmund we want to strengthen democracy education in our schools and thus lay the foundations for a lively, future-proof city society.
To this end we will: • support the participatory design of schoolyards and classrooms.

Safe and child-friendly school routes The school route is often the first step for children to become independent.
However, many streets in Dortmund are not yet safe enough for our youngest children.
We GREENS are committed to ensuring that all children can come to school safely and independently – on foot, by bike or by public transport.
Only in this way can we reduce traffic chaos in front of schools, promote the health of our children and make an important contribution to climate protection.
Projects such as “So läuft das!” are part of a modern traffic education in connection with modern municipal school route planning.
These should be consistently expanded.
To further facilitate the way to school for students, • Implement a 30 km/h speed limit in the vicinity of all schools.
• to enable and financially support the establishment of a bicycle workshop at every school.
• to establish “school streets”, where temporary motor vehicle access is prohibited during peak arrival and departure times (based on the “Vienna model”).
• to create safe bicycle paths and bicycle parking spaces at schools.
• to create “parent stops” as drop-off and pick-up zones at a safe distance from schools.
• to promote school route plans, “walking bus” and “bicycle bus” initiatives at schools.
• to improve public transport connections to schools, especially in the suburbs.
• to open up cultural institutions, offers and events, especially outside the city centre, and to support them.

• Strongly advocate for a “Kombiticket Kultur” (combined cultural ticket) that allows free use of public transport to events at all Dortmund cultural institutions.
• Strongly advocate for cultural offerings in Dortmund to become more digital.
Culture for the future Culture is a reflection of society.
That is why municipal culture and the framework conditions for the free scene must continue to develop.
A central part of this is that all people should work under fair conditions and be paid fairly for their work.
We know that this is unfortunately not always the case in the field of art and culture.
In addition, we want to promote and support new and existing cultural offerings.
That is why we will • strive for our own cultural department and have a cultural development plan drawn up and implemented.
• strengthen cultural infrastructure and support by expanding cultural offerings in all districts, promoting cultural centres and sociocultural centres and continuing to provide financial support to the free cultural scene.
• strengthen cooperation and participation by strengthening cooperation between the free scene, cultural associations and educational institutions, in order to create creative spaces for culture.
Culture is more than just a visit to the theatre or an exhibition – it is the heart of our city.
It tells stories, brings people together and makes Dortmund lively.
It pulsates in museums and cinemas, in libraries and music schools, in graffiti on house walls, on large stages and in small spaces.
Culture needs space – and it needs openness.
It should not be a privilege, but should be accessible to everyone.
Because culture is created where people can express themselves, where they meet, where they help to shape their city.
We are committed to making culture visible in Dortmund – in every district, for every generation, regardless of the size of their wallet.
We want to preserve and strengthen Dortmund as a place We Greens are committed to a cultural basic supply that is accessible to all people regardless of their origin, age or income.
This is how we create the basis for a lively cultural landscape that • The Dortmund Guides and the Night Mayor - master/mistress for strengthening nightlife - • The curfew lifted.

• The offer of the "Library of Things" expanded.
For a lively nightlife We are committed to a colorful, active and safe nightlife in Dortmund.
For example, we have already abolished the curfew and introduced the position of night mayor.
In the future, we want to make Dortmund's nightlife more attractive and more suitable for a big city.
That's why we will: • create a central, alcohol-free space where Dortmund residents can spend time together at night, for example, following the example of the former Bochum Stadtstrand.
• continue to offer the central Silvesterfeier and expand it with a laser or drone show, to offer a joint, low-threshold celebration and a counter-offer to the excessive burning of fireworks.
• further expand the Dortmund Guides, who do great work for a positive and safe nightlife, and use them at several locations at night.

• continue to support existing and new remembrance culture projects.
• support cooperation between cultural institutions throughout the Ruhr area.
For modern libraries Our libraries play an important role in Dortmund.
Not only do they provide access to literature for all people, but through their events, courses and as learning locations, they are indispensable for education and social cohesion in our city.
By That is why we will • promote local libraries and bookshops and expand them in other urban areas and finance and implement necessary renovations.

For strong sports clubs, sports clubs are more than places of movement – they are social anchor points that connect generations and promote integration.
However, many clubs are struggling with problems with the next generation, the lack of committed volunteers and dilapidated infrastructure.
Against this, we will: • simplify the management of funding so that clubs can compensate their volunteers instead of having to forego this due to bureaucracy.
• support clubs in dealing with bureaucratic hurdles during renovation work and create a central advice centre that supports clubs with questions about funding, digitisation and sustainable club development.
• evaluate, strengthen and continue the improvement of girls’ participation in sports that have previously been dominated by men, as currently twice as many boys as girls are members of sports clubs.
• continue the donation of sports vouchers to children in kindergarten to be redeemed at clubs and establish them as a permanent measure.
• integrate sports clubs into the comprehensive school Lack of barrier-free offers, too high costs or inadequate sports facilities exclude people.
We want to change that!
Everyone in Dortmund should have the opportunity to move – regardless of age, origin, gender or physical abilities.
We are fighting for an inclusive, diverse sports community that does not exclude anyone.
Because sport belongs in the center of our city – for a Dortmund in which everyone can move freely and with joy.
Sport is not just found in the clubs or in the Signal Iduna Park, but throughout the entire city.
Many Dortmunders use the parks, for example, to be active and to relax.
We see this as an opportunity to make our city even better, greener and healthier.
That is why we will • Promote sports facilities for all age groups from children to • Inclusive sports offers with barrier-free sports halls or projects such as Sail Together on the Phönix-See.
• Install new Calisthenics facilities throughout the city.

For sports facilities that are fit The sports infrastructure in our region is in many places dilapidated and no longer meets the requirements of a modern, inclusive society.
Good sports offers also require a well-developed and functioning infrastructure, so that sport is not an unfulfilled wish for many people.
That is why we will: • improve the condition of the gymnasiums, provide them with electronic locking systems and equip them in a modern way.
• create sustainable sports facilities and improve existing sports facilities in this regard.
• promote multifunctional sports facilities, both for different • continue to fight for the preservation and renovation of the Nordbad and to maintain the Hardenberg outdoor pool.
• make digital payment methods possible in the world of sports and other sports offers.
Inclusion on the field Sporting activities must be accessible to all people – regardless of physical limitations.
For us, the participation of all people in sports is a central concern.
People with disabilities still encounter numerous barriers when they want to do sports.
In order to consistently remove these barriers, we will: • support clubs in their work and promote more inclusive projects, for example through municipal contact persons and advice for the establishment of inclusive offers.
• introduce inclusive criteria for the allocation of halls.
• further develop inclusive sports offers and adapt them to the requirements of people with disabilities.
• ensure that changing rooms, sanitary facilities, playing and sports areas in sports halls are redesigned to be barrier-free.
• continue to financially support the StadtSportBund in order to compensate for learning deficits in the area of swimming, so that all Dortmund residents can learn to swim.
• Make public swimming pools affordable, with children, students, trainees and senior citizens being able to use them free of charge in the future.
• Use swimming pools for multiple purposes, for example for rehabilitation sports, in order to ensure the profitability of additional pools.
• Strengthen eSports as part of youth and cultural promotion by financially and structurally supporting eSports clubs and initiatives in Dortmund, promoting tournaments and events, providing public spaces for training and competitions, and building cooperations with schools and youth centers in order to establish eSports as a recognized leisure and educational opportunity.
For responsibility in sport Sport teaches values such as fairness, tolerance and respect and can reduce prejudices.
It also promotes social integration.
In particular, sports clubs make a major contribution to this.
In order to meet the responsibility of sport, • Women's and girls' sport will continue to be actively promoted.
• Accompany clubs in their work against violence, especially against sexualized and racially motivated violence, for which there must be contact points in every club and trainers must be sensitized and regularly retrained.
• Prefer sports facilities for children, women, people with disabilities or senior citizens in order to improve the existing offer.
• Ensure the participation of trans* and inter people in sports offers.
• Promote projects that advocate fairness and mutual respect in sports, such as inclusive tournaments.
• Support the work of the Fan Project Dortmund, which organizes political youth education at the stadium, intercultural football tournaments for children and young people, and visits to NS memorials, thus making an important contribution to democracy and human rights.

• Work together with the StadtS In order to create this sporting incentive, we will • retain the Rote Erde stadium as an athletics stadium and not subordinate it to the use as a football stadium for the second men's team or the women's team of BVB.
• finally complete the running track in this regard, which has already been secured for immediately after the European Championship.
• expand a second stadium in Dortmund for regional league football, so that regional league clubs from Dortmund no longer have to use stadiums in other cities.
• build the sports hall at U as planned for basketball and handball and also strive for league suitability for volleyball.
• identify further needs in other sports in which league promotions are currently prevented by a lack of infrastructure and promote this infrastructure.

Municipal Election Program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GR For a city without discrimination Diversity in Dortmund is a strength.
We want a city in which everyone has the same opportunities and in which discrimination in all its forms is resolutely combated.
To achieve this, we will: • open up the measures of economic development and actively support start-ups.
• simplify bureaucracy to make it easier to access start-up initiatives, provide information and set up a multilingual advice centre to promote the start of self-employment.
• expand the Centre for Ethnic Economics.
• work towards Dortmund having its own museum of migration, which documents the history of immigration and acknowledges the contribution of immigrants to the development of the city.
• actively and inclusively shape the process of participation, because “Dortmund for all” means arrival, participation, diversity and co-creation.
• ensure that non-academic men also find a reliable voice as an interest group and make participation opportunities more attractive for all social groups.
• make antidiscrimination training compulsory for all employees in the authorities to ensure that prejudices and discrimination are systematically combated.
• set up a department for antid • to continue to support the reporting centre for racism, which was funded by the state in 2023.DIVERSITY Dortmund is a city of diversity, encounter and openness.
It is shaped by the people who live, work and engage here – regardless of where they come from, what language they speak, what religion they practice, what abilities they have or what gender and sexual identity they have.
Although Dortmund is a city that stands for a cosmopolitan and diverse civil society in many areas, there are still many forms of discrimination that negatively affect the lives of many people.
These discriminations often occur in everyday encounters, whether in school, at work or on the street.
They manifest themselves in racist, sexist, disability-hostile and queer-hostile prejudices that disadvantage and exclude people.
Our vision is a city in which everyone can live without fear of discrimination, with equal opportunities and the freedom to develop individually.
Racism, anti-Semitism, queer-hostility and other forms of discrimination have no place in Dortmund.
Diversity must be understood and promoted as a strength.
This Our city should be a place of solidarity and respectful coexistence, where diversity is seen as an enrichment and not as a threat.
It is particularly important to us to actively involve people in the process of change who have not been heard enough so far.
We must ensure that all groups in Dortmund have the opportunity to participate, to express their needs and to help shape solutions.
Only in this way can we • bring the self-organization of migrants on the way.
• put the monument for guest workers and a colonialism monument in the harbor on the way.
• strengthen migrant associations and initiatives.
• organize the 0+1 Festival and the Afro-Ruhr Festival.

• improve the connection of organizations and initiatives from the migrant sector to the urban society.
• in a municipal information offer, make voluntary offers known.
For real co-determination, co-determination is the key to a lively democracy and an inclusive urban society and for people with an international history, a central prerequisite for integration.
However, many migrants – especially non-EU citizens – are still excluded from important democratic processes.
This not only prevents political participation, but also makes social integration more difficult.
We are committed to ensuring that political co-determination is possible for all people in Dortmund, regardless of their origin.
Participation must not only exist in theory, but must be designed to be accessible and barrier-free in practice.
This means that participation formats must become more diverse, the administration and politics must act more openly and commitment must be actively promoted.
Dortmund must be a city in which all people have the opportunity to participate, whether in politics, in associations, in the administration or in cultural initiatives.
For this, concrete measures are needed that remove barriers, strengthen self-organisation and make political processes accessible to all.
That is why we will • fight for municipal voting rights for all migrants, regardless of their origin.
• fight at the state and federal level for non-German residents in Dortmund to be allowed to vote.
• strengthen the role of the Committee for Integration and Equality in Dortmund municipal politics and advocate for the examination of additional competencies and rights, for example through non-voting members from civil society in the Committee for Integration.
• establish the appointment of knowledgeable residents from non-EU states with the right to speak in all committees following the Düsseldorf model in the election period from 2025 to 2030.
• increase the personnel capacities in the support structures and establish a position for acquiring financial resources in order to promote existing support and housing offers.
• intensify the counselling for job search and vocational training for immigrants from South-East Europe and the Western Balkans.
• introduce a municipal programme to support immigrants from South-East Europe and the Western Balkans.
Participation that connects integration is the key to a strong and just society.
In Dortmund, all people – regardless of their origin, culture or social background – should have the same opportunities to actively participate in social life.
Integration means Therefore we will • drive forward the implementation of the “Master Plan Integration”.
• secure the financial resources for established integration projects and reverse or compensate for cuts in order to maintain and expand integration offers.
• view and promote integration and political education as an investment in the future, as poor integration leads to social exclusion and promotes prejudices against migrants.
• take measures to create low-threshold access to integration offers and to make access to funding more efficient.
• expand the Office for Migration to include the area of integration and in particular the Migration & Integration Service Centre (MigraDo).
• establish the Municipal Integration Centre Dortmund (MIA-DO-KI) and supplement it with further offers in order to ensure more effective networking and support for migrants.
• establish voluntary language mediator pools, where voluntary interpreters support people who have difficulties with the German language in their everyday lives and thereby promote social participation, for example by accompanying them to schools, day care centres, authorities and non-profit organisations as independent third parties.
• do everything possible at the municipal level and help people with an immigration background to become German citizens.
• make the naturalisation act more dignified and valuable and hold annual celebrations for newly naturalised people.
• offer sufficient language and integration courses, also in day care centres and schools, as well as with flexible offers for people with care obligations or inflexible working hours.
• offer language and integration promotion especially for EU immigrants without legal entitlement to integration courses.
• develop a holistic approach that thinks both decentralised and networked, so that integration measures are effective and sustainable, without the municipal elections in 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUNDFor a diverse society Diversity must also be visible in city life – in sport, in clubs and in cultural offers.
To promote this diversity and make it more accessible is crucial for an inclusive urban society.
For this we will • promote diversity in sport, among other things through programmes in schools.
• make the diversity of sport and leisure activities in Dortmund more visible and better mediated.
• prepare information on offers in such a way that all people can access the diverse opportunities in Dortmund.

• link culture and integration more closely in order to make cultural diversity in Dortmund more visible and tangible.
• support the project “imdo” of the Alevitische Gemeinde Dortmund e.V., which actively promotes intercultural dialogue, social participation and democratic education and is aimed at people with an international history.
For queer life in Dortmund In Dortmund, people should be able to live freely and safely regardless of their sexual identity.
At the same time, queer diversity is an enrichment for our urban society.
However, queer people still experience discrimination in many areas of life – from school and education to the labor market and health care.
Trans*, inter and non-binary people often face additional hur In addition, there are specific needs for queer seniors, young people and LSBTIQ* people with a migration history, which must be specifically taken into account (the abbreviation LSBTIQ* stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, intersex, queer).
• Integration and urban development should be more closely linked in order to prevent social and ethnic separation.

• • leave the established political spaces and go where (young) people are, to enable low-threshold political participation.
• actively seek out conversations with non-politically active people and develop a “methodology” to make it easier for them to get involved in political processes.
• ensure that the city actively provides resources to make it possible for people to access spaces for irregular purposes.
• introduce neighbourhood ambassadors in Dortmund, following the example of the Polytechnische Gesellschaft foundation, to enable greater social participation by people between the ages of 15 and 27.

We are fighting for a city in which queer people not only live safely, but can also actively participate and develop.
For this, protection spaces must be expanded, political structures strengthened and queer organizations specifically supported.
It is also particularly important to us to focus on LSBTIQ* youth, who are often confronted with social pressure and prejudices during their identity search.
That is why we will take specific measures to further promote equality, participation and acceptance of LSBTIQ* people in Dortmund.
• continue to implement and further develop the LSBTIQ* action plan against the discrimination of LSBTIQ* people, which we initiated.

Municipal At the same time, it is indispensable for many social, cultural and ecological projects.
Citizen participation must not only be accessible to a small group of committed people.
Often, it is the same voices that are heard in processes, while many others are left out.
We want to expand participation formats in order to involve more people.
This also includes people with disabilities, who must be included through barrier-free access and continuous texts.
Young people must be given the opportunity to participate in politics in a low-threshold manner.
This way, we can also work on increasing voter turnout and thus mobilize people for democratic elections.
Associations, organizations and groups are also central actors of democracy.
They enable political education, social commitment and communal exchange.
Councils are important interfaces between citizens and the administration and must be strengthened beyond their advisory function.
That is why we will • make Dortmund the leading city of commitment in the Ruhr area by structurally strengthening and better promoting voluntary commitment.
• initiate a major municipal campaign on democracy and diversity, which shows participation formats and motivates participation.
• further develop existing participation concepts.
• develop modern, digital and transparent participation platforms that enable more people to participate, and introduce a digital e-petition system with a signature function based on the model of the German Bundestag for the city and the city districts.

Every single one of these voices contributes to how our city looks, how it can be experienced and where it is developing.
A lively democracy needs people who want to think along, speak up and help shape things.
But still many voices remain unheard.
Young people, people with disabilities, people without academic education and many with an international history are not sufficiently represented in political decisions.
We want to change this.
Democracy must not be an exclusive space.
It must be open to everyone, understandable and accessible.
Whether in the neighbourhood, at school, at work or in the digital space, there needs to be opportunities for participation and co-decision making.
This is what we stand for in Dortmund.
We want to rethink participation, further develop existing formats and take new paths to involve as many people as possible.
Because those who live here should also be able to have a say!
Because democracy is not a given, it depends on an active and informed society.
In order to protect democratic values and to communicate their importance, education is needed to strengthen democratic principles in times of growing populism and fake news.
Our city is as strong as the voices that are heard in it – that is why we defend democracy every day.

Not least, the memory of the crimes of National Socialism is a central component of democratic education.
Those who consciously deal with history understand the significance of democratic values and recognise authoritarian and right-wing extremist tendencies early on.
• Existing contact points for those affected by discrimination, racism and anti-Semitism should be financially supported in the long term and specifically expanded to ensure rapid and effective support.

Democratic cohesion Democracy lives from the fact that all people can participate freely, safely and equally.
However, many people in Dortmund experience racism, antisemitism and other forms of discrimination every day – that is why it is necessary to consistently promote and secure counselling services that help and support these people.
Furthermore, democracy only works if political decisions are comprehensible and all people have access to relevant information.
Political education and intercultural exchange are also essential to promote democratic values and strengthen social cohesion.
Because democracy must be communicated from an early age.
Those who learn from a young age what co-determination means will also live and defend democratic values as an adult.
But adults must also be enabled to bear parliamentary responsibility.
In order to effectively combat right-wing extremism, it requires strong civil society engagement, well-networked prevention work and consistent prosecution of right-wing extremist offences.
At the same time, we must name and combat all forms of racism and group-based host We are fighting for a city that clearly takes a stand against the right – on the streets, in parliaments and in society as a whole.
Therefore we will • continue to prevent cooperation with the AfD by demanding that all democratic parties in Dortmund follow our example and clearly distance themselves from the AfD and their inhumane politics, as their rhetoric fuels hatred, divides society and relativizes the crimes of National Socialism.
• financially and structurally support civil society initiatives and alliances that fight against right-wing extremism.
• improve the networking of these groups in order to create a strong democratic network.
• introduce longer-term framework contracts for democracy-promoting projects in order to ensure sustainable financing.

• initiate a broad public debate on institutional racism in Dortmund, as it is evident in many • The police and judiciary are called upon to prosecute right-wing violence more consistently and to hold perpetrators accountable more quickly, including information events, media competence training and argumentation training against fake news and propaganda, as well as offers to promote a mature and critical approach to AI-generated content and social media.
• Education programmes against right-wing extremism are to be strengthened in order to actively counter democracy-hostile ideologies.
• New formats for political education are to be created specifically for children and young people.
• With targeted initiatives against hate speech and fake news, the manipulations of democracy enemies are to be exposed and explained.
• The remembrance work in Dortmund is to be further expanded and secured, so that the historical memory remains part of the social discourse.
• New, interactive memorial formats are to be developed, which in particular appeal to young people and motivate them to actively engage with history.
• Schools and educational institutions are to be specifically supported in implementing projects to deal with the Nazi era and to combat anti-Semitism and racism.
• Efforts are to be made to ensure that every schoolchild vis We stand firmly on their side and advocate for a city society that clearly positions itself against the right.
It is not only the classic neo-Nazism that threatens our democracy.
The AfD has become increasingly radicalized in recent years and is today a party that deliberately incites hatred, engages in racist hate speech and attacks democratic institutions.
It trivializes National Socialism, spreads conspiracy theories and, with its rhetoric, is a mental arsonist for right-wing extremist violence.
Its strategy is to drive social division and to undermine trust in democratic processes.
Right-wing extremism does not begin with open violence, but already where people are played off against each other, democratic values are called into question and hatred is used as a political strategy.
That is why we are fighting not only against the right-wing extremist scene on the street, but also against those who want to draw this ideology into the municipal election program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND.
• actively support and promote non-violent actions against Nazi marches, as • Strengthen the counselling for victims and defectors of the right-wing scene by permanently securing counselling centres such as BackUp-ComeBack, as they are essential for victims of right-wing violence and for successful prevention work, and by providing targeted support for victims of right-wing violence and defectors from the scene.
• Strengthen the Coordination Office for Diversity, Tolerance and Democracy by strengthening it in terms of personnel and finances, so that it can carry out its work in counselling, networking and developing strategies for action even more effectively, and by expanding the focus of the coordination office to networking and strategic planning in order to bundle civil society engagement more effectively.
Municipal Election Programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUNDFor a police force and law enforcement agencies that are close to the people We want a city in which all people can move freely, uninhibitedly and at the same time safely.
To achieve this, a police force that is close to the people is necessary, which treats all people fairly and respectfully • we will work to increase political participation in decisions regarding the tasks, content and areas of deployment of the police force.
• we will work to ensure that employees of the police force and other emergency services are protected from verbal and physical attacks and are advised in the case of complaints, for example through a reporting system and the continuation of the municipal specialist department for violence against emergency services and law enforcement, which was initiated by the GREENS.
SAFETY Dortmund is a city full of life, full of people, encounters and public spaces.
For this coexistence to be successful, we need to feel safe – on the way to school during the day, on the way home in the evening, and always on all paths.
However, safety means different things to different people.
While some people experience certain places as lively, for others these places mean stress, exclusion or even fear.
We believe in a concept of safety that takes the diversity of Dortmund seriously.
A city is safe when everyone feels safe there, regardless of where they come from, how they look or how they live.
Safety does not begin with blue lights, but with good lighting, accessible contact persons, respect This requires a police force that works closely with the public and is transparent, a security service that provides sensitive help and support, and municipal structures that provide protection without stigmatising.
Protection spaces are needed, as well as trust, accessibility and a clear stance against violence.
Dortmund has already taken important steps in many areas, and now it is time to take the next steps.
With an eye on social realities.
With an ear for those affected.
And with the goal that all people can experience this city as their safe place.
• The Master Plan for Municipal Security with the aspects of prevention and cooperation with social initiatives has been introduced.
• Local security concepts have been developed in neighbourhood laboratories together with residents.
• Training for dealing with people in psychological emergency situations has been introduced for the municipal security service.

• A commissioner against violence against emergency services and for consistent clarification and protection has been introduced.
• Campaign for respect towards rescue services and law enforcement.
• Personnel and material support for the Dortmund fire department.
• Review the visual alignment of the Ordnungsamt with the police, as for the majority of citizens they are hardly distinguishable and as a result the different tasks of the authorities are no longer separable visually or in terms of appearance.
• Conduct regular external evaluations of police and law enforcement measures in order to systematically identify and combat racism and discrimination.
For the protection of all people.
Only those who feel safe can feel comfortable!
We achieve this by reducing spaces of fear, increasing the quality of public spaces and low-threshold contact persons and good protection concepts.
In order for all people in Dortmund to feel comfortable, • increase the subjective safety through a higher quality of public spaces and rooms.
• Implement the results of the neighbourhood laboratories carried out with the participation of citizens in recent years with regard to the elimination of subjectively threatening places.
• Further develop the Dortmund app for technical fault reports (defective elevators, lighting, etc.).
• expand the Dortmund Guides' success model and increase subjective safety through their presence without them being part of the law enforcement agencies.
• establish a location in the city center as a central point of contact for the Dortmund Guides, which at the same time serves as a safe space in the nightlife through night-time opening hours.
• offer a contact point for all major city events together with civil society counseling services and the police, which can also be used as a safe space.
• introduce low-threshold protection concepts (based on the examples of "Luisa is here" or "Where's the next Panama?") at all city events and events in city facilities.
• also offer campaign materials for these protection concepts to private catering and cultural facilities.
• ensure that civil society counseling services can participate in these measures through personnel reinforcement.
• work towards ensuring that all people in our city can feel safe - whether families shopping, homeless people on Hellweg or friends on their way home from the pub - and that people in difficult life situations are supported according to the approach of prevention and help instead of repression and displacement.

• reverse the visual alignment of the order office with the police, as it is hardly distinguishable for the majority of citizens and, as a result, the different tasks of the authorities can no longer be separated visually or in appearance.
• carry out regular external evaluation of police and law enforcement measures in order to systematically recognize and combat racism and discrimination.
• establish a visible culture of error within the authorities through this evaluation and through further measures.

For a strong fire department and disaster control The fire department, the rescue service and the disaster control in Dortmund are well organised, which is mainly due to the high level of commitment of the main and honorary actors.
However, the demands on the fire department and disaster control are expected to increase due to the consequences of climate change and the ageing society.
In order to prepare Dortmund for this, we will • continue to pursue the goal that the rescue service reaches the location of the emergency within the protection times set by the Dortmund City Council.
• use intelligent traffic control also when using Cell Broadcast.
• update the existing Dortmund pandemic plan from 2012 on the basis of the experiences of the Corona pandemic.
• strengthen protection against the consequences of climate such as heat periods and drought, but also heavy rain with flooding through infrastructure and with the necessary financial means.
