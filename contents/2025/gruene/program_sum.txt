Dortmund's municipal election program aims to make the city a livable city for everyone.
The city faces challenges such as the climate crisis, social injustice, rising living costs and a system that is reaching its limits in many places.
BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN
Our goal is a city in which everyone arrives well – regardless of age, income or residential area.
A Dortmund that thinks about mobility in a new way – safe, stress-free, barrier-free.
With local public transport that is on time, affordable and well-developed.
With cycle and pedestrian paths that connect, rather than separate.
No one should be excluded in Dortmund – either by barriers or by high rents.
Housing should remain affordable – for families, young people in training, senior citizens and everyone who calls Dortmund their home.
We conserve our A healthy environment with more greenery, clean air and the preservation of biodiversity – for us, our parents and our children.
Dortmund has the potential to be a pioneer for a socio-ecological transformation – with innovative companies, strong universities, committed skilled workers.
The goal of climate neutrality must be achieved on all levels to preserve the living conditions for us and future generations.
By expanding renewable energy, climate-friendly heat supply and greater citizen participation in energy generation, we ensure that the energy transition is not only ecological, but also economical and social.
Climate neutrality is our goal.
We are shaping the way there with determination and a clear strategy to make Dortmund future-proof.
For climate neutrality in 2035.
The construction sector is one of the industries with the highest resource consumption.
Sustainability includes the reduction of climate-damaging emissions, energy neutrality, resource efficiency, circularity, barrier-free access and the creation of affordable housing.
For us, this means that climate-neutral and sustainable construction must be required and promoted.
We want to offer incentives for the implementation of sustainable construction projects in Dortmund and lead by example in municipal projects.
Rising prices for fossil energy sources will save the money of citizens, companies and municipalities.
We will energetically renovate the municipal property stock and convert it to a climate-neutral heat supply.
The future electricity supply should no longer be in the hands of just a few large companies.
The citizen and energy cooperatives will be the energy producers of the future and create added value in the city.
With the switch to renewable energy, we will gradually be able to do without such sources of previous energy generation.
De-paving enables better handling of heat and fine dust and makes a contribution to biodiversity.
Dortmund offers optimal conditions for long-distance and local heating networks.
Biomass plants can react flexibly to feed-in from solar and wind energy, whereby the bio-waste is utilised without the need to purchase biomass from factory farming.
Build district storage facilities for energy security.
Municipal election program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND.
Dortmund wants to expand its district heating network and use different energy sources.
The city also wants to use waste heat from biomass plants for district heating.
Dortmund wants to promote the use of smart meters to relieve the electricity grid and reduce expensive electricity prices during peak load times.
For the energy transition, we need the expansion of renewable energies, which has also gained momentum in Dortmund, says the mayor.
The mayor wants Dortmund to be a city that does not destroy, but preserves – for us.
Querbeet Dortmund wants to make Dortmund climate-friendly, species-rich and livable.
They want to preserve hedges, natural stone walls and greenery, to refrain from using pesticides and to create new small bodies of water.
They also want to protect animals and insects by reducing and dimming bright neon signs and building lights.
We want to seal off areas and allow the natural development of valleys.
We are convinced that we must live in Dortmund in harmony and with respect for nature.
We are planting 5000 future trees, subsidizing 1000 € per green roof and banning gravel gardens for the sake of species diversity.
Free bulky waste collection day implemented in all districts.
Zero-waste fund for initiatives established.
Industrial area in Brechten prevented.
With the decision of the ecological forestry concept, we have already come a long way.
Now it is time to implement it.
Identify needs for improving the stock of street trees and street greenery and make proposals for streets without any greenery in residential areas.
Replant dead trees on existing tree islands, replant empty tree islands and establish new tree islands in order to achieve the already decided goal of an additional 1000 trees.
Use location-appropriate and climate-resistant trees.
Heavy metals, medication residues and even microplastics are increasingly entering our rivers and waterways via municipal wastewater.
We do not see agricultural land use as an interim solution on the way to residential and commercial development.
The agricultural land in Dortmund has decreased by almost half since 1950.
The remaining land is absolutely essential to preserve for reasons of landscape protection and is an important part of regional food production and supply.
We will use the possibilities of contractual nature conservation and bind arable strips as ecologically managed buffer zones in adjacent nature reserves.
The EDG wants to establish a second-hand goods store with an attached repair café or upcycling workshop.
They also want to use the large, three-part waste bins with waste separation, which were used at EURO 2024, at central locations in the city and to a greater extent.
'We see it as our duty to stand up for defenceless creatures in our society and to be the advocates of the voiceless,' say the EDG.
Dortmund has a long-term plan to protect animals and the environment.
The city's election programme includes a ban on pesticides on municipal areas.
The plan also includes the creation of a position of a municipal animal welfare officer.
It also calls for the introduction of firework-free zones in the city centre and neighbourhood centres to protect wildlife and birds and to reduce CO2 and fine dust pollution.
The party also wants to transform the zoo into a modern educational institution in the long term.
The aim is a city of short distances on a human scale.
We create public spaces, green spaces close to home and inclusive living spaces for all people.
We will: • align neighbourhoods with the needs of the people who live there, with a housing supply that meets demand, social facilities such as childcare centres, meeting centres and care facilities, as well as good public transport connections.
• Upgrade courtyards in residential areas through more greenery and mixed use.
• Strengthen small-scale businesses and promote creative, cultural or social (interim) uses through the intelligent use of vacant spaces, especially commercial properties.
A livable city center is the heart of a future-proof Dortmund.
It must be a place where people like to stay, shop, work, live and spend time together.
Dortmund should be a city in which the basic resource of land serves people, not profit.
A fair land policy requires clear priorities: to treat land as a common good and to use it sustainably.
Speculation endangers affordable housing and social justice.
We want to ensure that an active municipal land policy paves the way for design options that serve the common good.
The city of Dortmund is characterised by its diversity – and that is precisely its strength.
A good way of living together needs places of encounter and coexistence that are accessible to all people equally and without obstacles.
We want to promote social togetherness and create shared spaces in which all people are welcome.
Whether in neighbourhoods, clubs or public spaces: our city should be a place where no one is excluded.
We will involve people, initiatives and associations on the ground early in planning processes and create new formats for this that appeal to everyone.
Average net cold rent has risen from €7.00 to €8.41 per m².
The vacancy rate was only 1.9% at the end of 2023.
Housing should not be a luxury.
It is a basic right that we must protect.
We are committed to ensuring that Dortmund remains a city where everyone can find a home – regardless of their income.
We aim to ensure that rent should not exceed 30% of disposable income.
We must support those who, for various reasons, have difficulty finding a place on the general housing market.
Dortmund needs a realistic strategy to create more living space.
The best approach is to use existing potential: expand buildings, convert unused office and commercial space into living space, convert attic spaces and convert misused and vacant spaces.
Without construction of new residential buildings, it will not work.
Municipal housing companies must play a central role here and create additional living space to ensure high quality at the same time as affordability.
Serially constructed residential buildings can make a powerful contribution to quickly and inexpensively creating living space.
Strongly promote cooperatives and community-oriented building communities to increase the non-profit housing stock.
Dortmund is to become a pioneer of a modern, future-oriented economic region.
We want to keep skilled workers in the region, strengthen educational and training opportunities and further develop jobs according to social and ecological criteria.
Renewable energies and green technologies are to become the standard in industry.
Emission-free delivery concepts and micro depots will relieve the city.
We will specifically promote the circular economy, sustainable innovations and community-oriented companies.
We want to strengthen Dortmund as a location for technological and social innovation.
Good work means fair pay, collective bargaining, co-determination, health protection and equal opportunities - regardless of educational background or origin.
Dortmund's companies are encouraged to assess their social impact in terms of climate protection, social justice and participation.
A one-stop shop for the trades is being set up to implement the municipal election programme 2025, offering young people from other regions affordable housing in order to work and live in Dortmund.
We will support the integration of long-term unemployed people even more effectively by offering targeted qualification and further education programmes.
Women are still underrepresented in MINT professions (i.e.
professions in the fields of mathematics, computer science, natural sciences and technology) Women must be made more visible as leaders and role models and actively encouraged to take up technical professions.
Urban production centers and smart factories offer the potential to promote innovative and sustainable production methods.
For Dortmund as a business location, it is of central importance to set the right impulses for a sustainable and future-proof development.
By promoting innovations and strengthening the qualifications of the population, we want to set a course for a resilient and resilient city.
We must offer founders an environment in which they can not only successfully start their companies, but also grow and prosper in the long term.
By promoting university spin-offs and start-ups, we want to ensure that innovative companies remain in Dortmund and can grow here.
Sustainability must be taken into account in all areas of the economy, especially in the development of business sites.
We want to encourage cooperation between the Ruhr district municipalities in the rehabilitation of brownfield sites and in the coordination of a uniform business tax rate.
Support the establishment of urban production Municipal Election Program 2025.
Positioning visitors.
Promoting green and sustainable commercial spaces.
Small and medium-sized companies are the backbone of the Dortmund economy.
Companies that use sustainable production methods will be actively supported.
The Technology Centre will be commissioned to use its special fund to build a craft and trade yard based on the model of Munich Craft and Trade Yard and Technology Centre GmbH.
The aim is to further develop the inner-city trade, create attractive shopping areas and sustainable and future-proof business models.
The city centre and trade are of central importance for Dortmund, not only from an economic perspective, but also for the quality of life of the citizens.
An attractive city centre with a diverse, sustainable trade ensures a strong local economy and promotes social and cultural integration.
Our goal is to further develop Dortmund as an attractive scientific location with international influence.
We rely on easily accessible, lively university locations, new spaces for exchange and networking as well as clear strategies for research, innovation and securing skilled workers.
The city should lead by example and set sustainability, transparency and independence as the focus for procurement, software use and infrastructure.
Open source solutions, fair procurement criteria and ecological standards are central instruments.
Administration and digitalisation are closely linked.
Only if both are designed for the future and implemented responsibly can Dortmund be a viable and modern city for all.
Citizen-oriented administration forms the backbone of a functioning urban society.
But in Dortmund it shows that many administrative areas are overloaded.
Long waiting times, a growing number of unresolved tasks and slow digital tools are to blame.
We want an administration that is not only better organised, but also approachable, open to learning and innovation.
Processes should be faster, more comprehensible and more user-friendly.
The city of Dortmund is responsible for a community-oriented municipality.
The municipal election program 2025 and the municipal enterprises will each be at least half-staffed with women.
The equal treatment of severely disabled people should be a priority.
The city, together with the municipal subsidiaries, is the largest local employer in the city.
The communal economy is a step on the way to an economic system that primarily places people at the center.
By 2035, a proportion of around 40% of the current workforce will retire from the city administration.
We see it as our responsibility to strengthen the city as a good and attractive employer.
To this end, we will: • improve training conditions with more money and favourable trainee accommodation as well as an extended trial phase of the final work area.
The city is developing Dortmund into a smart city.
The focus is on a future-proof digital infrastructure, free and equal access to the network for all.
This enables free action on the net, innovation and fair competition.
The digitalization of the city administration saves work in the medium term and simplifies and accelerates processes, which optimizes the administrative structures.
The city has joined the international alliance Cities for Digital Rights and introduced free WLAN in city trains.
Digital transformation is a central issue for the future of Dortmund.
IT technologies offer enormous potential for economic and social development.
An open-source economy not only promotes free access to technologies, but also strengthens digital sovereignty and cooperation.
We have already created a position for open source and will be drawing up a short-term timetable for the digital infrastructure in for social services, booking systems and reporting of defects.
We will continue to support the city of Dortmund’s “Smart City Strategy” and place particular emphasis on the bundling of systems.
Dortmund will use the topic of sustainability in digitalisation as a criterion when awarding development projects.
A municipal AI competence center in Dortmund Municipal Election Program 2025 demand a sovereign city administration.
An Open Source initiative for Dortmund in order to promote the use of Open Source software and technologies in municipal institutions and companies.
We will offer and expand green bonds from the city and its companies as a means of financing climate and environmental protection, and to make further offers available to both citizens and institutional investors.
For transparent financial management with the participation of citizens, we will provide citizens with an interactive and more transparent presentation of the budget.
We want to enable all people to have self-determined mobility.
To do this, everyone must be able to reach school, work, leisure facilities, friends and family.
We want to make Dortmund a city in which pedestrian traffic, cycling and public local transport offer a good alternative to car traffic.
By reducing travel times, we increase safety in mobility.
Even people who are dependent on cars will benefit from the principle of driving slower and arriving faster.
MACHT DORTMUND Municipal Election Program 2025 Fläche / Smart Rhino to connect this new district to public transport, largely without cars in the visible cityscape.
We will densify the frequency of buses and trains, especially at night and on weekends, and start U-Bahn service earlier on.
Overall, we will achieve a more climate-friendly, healthier and safer mobility.
For us, it is clear: The bus ride must be comfortable.
And the bus must arrive on time!
A powerful, modern public transport system is a win for everyone.
Fewer cars mean less noise, better air quality and more space in our city.
An attractive local transport system makes life easier, fairer and more climate-friendly.
Because mobility is a fundamental right – and we ensure that it applies to everyone.
For more buses and trains in Dortmund.
We will focus the priorities – both in planning and financing – on a well-developed public Transport system.
The expansion of Dortmund's Stadtbahn network has come to a standstill since 2008.
There is a need for more barrier-free access, reliable travel times and a higher frequency in the existing network.
The Deutschlandticket represents a revolution in the pricing of local transport and in overcoming tariff boundaries.
We support the continuation of this ticket.
More people should be able to use and want to use public transport.
Therefore, there should be no cuts in services.
Operating costs must be covered in the coming years.
At the same time, further expansion of public transport is necessary.
We will direct more DSW21 funds into the operation and expansion ofpublic transport, e.
g.
through savings in the subsidies for the airport.
Dortmund aims to build a continuous and safe cycle route for all on the B1 as a city road.
Plan and implement two-way cycle paths on both sides of major main roads.
install more green right-turn arrows for cyclists at traffic lights.
Work more with pictogram chains to assert the right of way of the road for cycling.
Create more staff in the administration for the planning of infrastructure measures.
Dortmunders should be able to quickly and directly reach their destination by bike.
We need a seamless cycle network with short, direct routes – because the best cycle path should not be longer than the route by car.
We can only increase the proportion of cycling traffic if a safe infrastructure is guaranteed.
That is why we are focusing on separate cycle lanes on main roads and traffic-calming measures in side streets.
Dortmund aims to reduce the number of traffic fatalities to zero and thus achieve the European “Vision Zero’ in Dortmund.
The most important thing in cycling is attractive, physically separate, conflict-free and asphalted infrastructure.
Every Dortmund resident should be able to shape their everyday life with the bike.
Our goal for Dortmund: All roads must be safe for cyclists to use for this we will no longer set up any more joint foot and cycle paths in the interior.
We are committed to ensuring that barrier-free planning is implemented throughout the city – not just in the traditional sense in public spaces, but also digitally.
To achieve this, we will introduce a city-wide barrier- free concept that identifies existing obstacles and provides concrete solutions for PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC.
We are committed.
to a city in which all people can move around safely and freely – whether on foot, in a wheelchair or with a pram.
The transport revolution also means making pedestrian traffic safer and more attractive.
The design of our streets must take into account the weakest road users, so that everyone feels equally safe.
In every re-planning and new planning of roads, create wider sidewalks (at least 2.5 m) and enough safe crossing possibilities.
Use more physical barriers like bollards or plantings to prevent parking on sidewalks.
We will convert the B1 into a city street for all Dortmund residents by diverting through traffic and regional traffic to the A2 and A1.
We will not implement the Nordspange as a continuous truck route beyond the Bornstraße to the Emscherallee and will only implement the eastern section of the “Hoesch-Allee’ as the development of the Westfalenhütte, if possible, with only two lanes.
We want to raise awareness of the fact that cars are left unused in public spaces for the majority of the time.
We have finally managed to increase parking fees, which had been low for years.
Parking fees to be raised moderately in the long term, in order to create a stronger incentive for the use of public transport, bicycles or footpaths.
A pilot project to be set up soon to build a municipal neighbourhood car park in a suitable, densely populated neighbourhood in the inner city and to issue prepaid parking permits for the residents.
Park-and-ride offers at light rail stops in the outskirts.
We would like to strengthen the tried and tested traffic concept “Drive slower, arrive faster” in Dortmund.
A lower speed leads to increased traffic safety for all, to reduced noise and pollutant emissions, to a lower CO2 output, to better air quality, especially in the summer.
For these reasons, we will exhaust the municipal possibilities to introduce a 30 km/h speed limit as the maximum speed in the city centre.
We will also promote further measures to prevent car racing, which endangers human lives and causes enormous noise pollution.
Dortmund wants to give parked and driving cars less space to create more space for people.
This also mitigates the consequences of the heating of residential areas through more greening and fewer pollutants.
Bikesharing, carsharing and e-scooters are thus part of the transport revolution.
Dortmund wants to build up a close network of defined and non-obstructive parking stations that apply to all providers.
In the urban area, a maximum distance of 500 m for car-sharing stations and 200 m for e- scooter and metropolitan bike stations.
The operation of Dortmund Airport is neither economically nor socially nor environmentally sensible.
Closing the airport offers the opportunity to return a large area to the city, which is ready for ecologically valuable and sustainable new development.
In the past decades, the airport has been subsidized with funds from DSW21 in the three-digit million range.
The money could have been used more sensibly in the expansion of public transport.
We will no longer accept the financing of the airport at the expense of other corporate areas.
We fight for a Dortmund that is oriented towards the needs of those who are often overlooked.
We stand for a city in which children can grow up free of poverty, families can find support and young people can be taken seriously.
We reject a policy of displacement and criminalisation and instead focus on health care, prevention, advice and safe spaces.
Every third child in Dortmund lives in poverty or is threatened by poverty.
We want to tackle poverty at its roots and not just its symptoms.
We are fighting for a society in which all people can lead a dignified life and no one is left behind.
Social security is a fundamental right and the basis for real participation in social life.
The previous measures to combat poverty are not enough.
Poverty in old age, especially among women, must not be a societal norm.
Housing First finally introduced.
Extensive financial support for welfare associations and social carriers.
The goal of overcoming homelessness by 2030 decided and an action plan against homelessness initiated.
The current drug consumption room first expanded and then saved, and the establishment of further consumption locations initiated.
Green politics is a drug policy based on prevention, concrete help for drug-addicted people, decriminalization and scientific findings.
We are working to mitigate the damage to those affected by providing consumption spaces, drug checking, health care and outreach social work.
Employment means more than just earning a living.
It provides structure, meaning and social participation.
We stand for a labour market policy that puts people at the centre and leaves no one behind.
Homelessness and the lack of housing are not the result of individual failures, but of social inequality, the housing shortage and a lack of social security.
Therefore we will not accept: • the displacement of homeless people from the cityscape through bans or architecture that is hostile to humans (for example Anti-homeless benches).
• fines for homeless people for camping and sleeping in public spaces, as well as for sleeping on park benches.
We Greens are committed to preventing homelessness, strengthening social security and helping those affected quickly and without red tape.
Our goal is a city in which no one has to live without a decent home.
We want to pursue this goal in Dortmund as well, in line with the EU’s goal of overcoming homelessness by 2030.
The city of Dortmund has set itself the goal of overcoming homelessness by 2030.
The Municipal Election Programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND aims to prevent homelessness not only in the short term, but structurally.
The aim is to ensure that homeless people receive long-term support – with affordable housing, social support and career prospects.
Dortmund has a responsibility to ensure social justice, participation and protection for people in very different life situations.
This includes women, who are still structurally disadvantaged, as well as refugees, older people, people with disabilities or sex workers.
Dortmund should be a city where equality is not just a promise, but a reality.
A city that does not tolerate poverty in old age, loneliness, housing shortages and discrimination.
Women still experience structural disadvantages in almost all areas of life.
At least one third of all women living in Germany experience physical, psychological or sexualized violence.
The fact that a femicide occurs almost every day is a social and political scandal.
We want all people in Dortmund to be able to live freely, safely and equally regardless of gender.
In Dortmund, around 120,000 people over the age of 65 live.
They are a valuable part of our society.
Their life experience, knowledge and commitment enrich our coexistence.
We are committed to ensuring that all people can age with dignity and participate actively in social life until old age.
We want a community in which diversity is experienced as an enrichment and barriers are consistently removed.
Strengthen the Senior Citizens' Council and expand its opportunities for participation.
Redefine senior citizens' meeting places as intergenerational urban spaces and low-threshold meeting centers.
Support self-help facilities for senior citizens.
Adjust health care to an aging population.
We stand for a refugee policy that places human rights at the center and sees integration as an opportunity.
We are guided by the conviction that every person deserves protection and a life in safety and dignity – regardless of their origin or the reason for their flight.
We categorically reject the so-called ‘payment card for refugees’
Sex work and prostitution are social realities that require differentiated political responses.
We are committed to an approach that places the rights of prostitutes and the self-determination of sex workers at the center.
At the same time we take a firm stance against human trafficking and forced prostitution.
Our goal is a policy that protects those affected, rather than stigmatizing them.
For voluntary work as the heart of the city In Dortmund, thousands of people are voluntarily active in clubs and initiatives to help others.
This commitment deserves not only our recognition, but also our active support.
For this, we need reliable framework conditions.
Too often, valuable initiatives fail due to bureaucratic hurdles or lack of resources.
The city must act as a facil
We are proud that the health of the people is our top priority, not what brings in the most money.
As a city, take on the sponsorship of a rescue ship and specifically take in more refugees who have been rescued from distress at sea.
We support the Social-Ecological Center (SÖZ) and the Municipal Election Program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND.
In our city, there are major differences in how well people are medically cared for.
Medical services that are accessible and affordable for everyone must not be a privilege.
Dortmund must fulfil its responsibility to ensure a stable hospital structure and good medical care in every district.
A healthy city needs accessible practices, fair working conditions, safe maternity wards, prevention services for all age groups and genders and a strong municipal hospital.
We want to implement measures that improve everyday life, make structures fairer and understand health as a common task.
The Klinikum Dortmund is a special guarantor for the health of our city as a municipal hospital of maximum care.
Loneliness can affect anyone and has far-reaching health consequences, even through interactions with physical illnesses.
We want to strengthen the important fight against loneliness in Dortmund and use the municipal opportunities.
Therefore we will set up drinking fountains at many locations so that all people in Dortmund can get free access to clean water, especially on hot days.
We stand for a healthy city.
This includes the inclusion of psychological health in addition to physical health.
All citizens should have access to the advice and treatment they need.
Mental health care is not good enough in many places.
We need more places where people with mental illnesses and their relatives can exchange their experiences.
We want to take into account the needs of all genders in the health system.
We advocate the legalization of cannabis and responsible consumption in accordance with the rules for cigarettes and alcohol.
We see consumption bans in the immediate vicinity of facilities for children, young people and students as important.
We need measures to de-stigmatize and more offers to enable mental health.
We will promote projects such as “Breakfast for all’ and work to ensure that the successful and world-renowned DONALD study is also continued in Dortmund.
We want every child in Dortmund to have access to high-quality care.
We place particular value on a non-discriminatory access to all nurseries.
In doing so, we rely on flexible concepts that meet the different needs of families.
Dortmund should become a city in which all young people can grow up, develop freely and fully exploit their potentials.
We stand for access to reliable, high-quality and local childcare for all families in Dortmund.
Since 2020, 18 new day care centers have been created and the number of care places has been expanded by around 1,800.
Our goal is a day care place for every child who wants one.
Until then, child day care will remain an important and necessary form of care.
In many neighbourhoods, attractive play areas and safe routes are lacking.
We want to change this and advocate for more child-friendly open spaces.
We will: • Review Council decisions for child-friendliness.
• Establish more traffic-calmed areas and 30 km/h zones in residential areas.
We want to support and value all family forms – single parents with children, patchwork families, same-sex or trans* parents, care communities or the nuclear family.
For a sufficient support offer for young people, we will increasingly focus on low-threshold offers for children and young people at the places where they spend time.
The mental health of young people is a task for society as a whole.
We will use school psychologists at every secondary school and strengthen the school psychological counseling center.
Young people have innovative ideas, fresh perspectives and the courage to initiate change.
Since they are not yet allowed to vote and only make up a small percentage of our ageing society, they are far too rarely heard and politics are often made without regard to their interests.
We do not want to shape Dortmund for children and young people, but with them.
In order to promote the participation of as many young people in Dortmund as possible, we will introduce a youth parliament.
We want sufficient school places, safe school routes and a stronger connection between school and the wider community.
In order to make Dortmund an attractive city for young people, we will establish more self-managed youth centres in all districts of the city, together with young people.
We Greens are committed to ensuring that every child in Dortmund receives a place at a well-equipped school in the immediate vicinity of their home.
2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND
Education is the key to equal opportunities and social participation.
Our schools must be places that impart knowledge, values and future opportunities.
Good school education lays the foundation for a self-determined life and strengthens the future of our city.
We are committed to an inclusive, modern and sustainable school landscape – with sufficient school places, good equipment, digital Education must be designed with the needs of children in mind.
Schools are more than just places of learning - they are living spaces.
It is our duty to design these spaces in such a way that they promote the well-being and development of our pupils.
A modern infrastructure and healthy food are essential for this.
Inclusion and individual support must not just be buzzwords, but must become a lived reality in everyday school life.
We want a school system that is oriented towards the needs of the children and not just to this end.
We want children and young people to grow up to be competent citizens in the digital world.
This also includes an understanding of the opportunities and risks of new technologies.
Our schools are more than just places of learning – they are a place of our democracy.
Here young people learn not only facts, but also how to discuss with one another, find compromises and take responsibility.
School routes are often the first step for children to become independent.
Many streets in Dortmund are not yet safe enough for our youngest children.
We are committed to ensuring that all children can come to school safely and independently – on foot, by bike or by public transport.
Only in this way can we reduce traffic chaos in front of schools and promote the health of our children.
To further facilitate the way to school for students, implement a 30 km/h speed limit in the vicinity of all schools.
To open up cultural institutions, offers and events, especially outside the city centre, and to support them.
To integrate the topic of immigration into the museum landscape and to expand programmes and projects that are aimed at people with a migration background.
To create more low-threshold offers and to open cultural institutions free of charge.
Culture is more than just a visit to the theatre or an exhibition – it is the heart of our city.
It tells stories, brings people together and makes Dortmund lively.
Culture needs space – and it needs openness.
It should not be a privilege, but should be accessible to everyone.
We are committed to making culture visible in Dortmund – in every district, for every generation.
We Greens are committed to a colorful, active and safe nightlife in Dortmund.
For example, we have already abolished the curfew and introduced the position of night mayor.
In the future, we want to make Dortmund's nightlife more attractive and more suitable for a big city.
That's why we will: • create a central, alcohol-free space where Dortmund residents can spend time together at night.
MEP 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND is the Municipal Election Programme 2025.
It aims to promote local libraries and bookshops and expand them in other urban areas.
It also aims to support cooperation between cultural institutions throughout the Ruhr area.
‘Sport in the park’ programme, following the Düsseldorf model, for all Dortmund residents, which offers uncommitted and free sports meet-ups for untrained and sporty people of all age groups.
‘We are fighting for an inclusive, diverse sports community that does not exclude anyone.
Because sport belongs in the center of our city – for a Dortmund in which everyone can move freely and with joy’
Dortmund's new mayor promises to improve the city's sports facilities.
Inclusive sports offers with barrier-free sports halls or projects such as Sail Together on the Phönix-See are on the way.
Sporting activities must be accessible to all people – regardless of physical limitations, says the mayor.
The election programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUNDdern makes a contribution.
Sport teaches values such as fairness, tolerance and respect and can reduce prejudices.
In order to meet the responsibility of sport, women's and girls' sport will continue to be actively promoted.
Accompany clubs in their work against violence, especially against sexualized and racially motivated violence.
Support the work of the Fan Project Dortmund, which organizes political youth education at the stadium, intercultural football tournaments for children and young people.
Dortmund is a city of diversity, encounter and openness.
It is shaped by the people who live, work and engage here – regardless of where they come from, what language they speak, what religion they practice, what abilities they have or what gender and sexual identity they have.
We want a city in which everyone has the same opportunities and in which discrimination in all its forms is resolutely combated.
To achieve this, we will: • open up the measures of economic development and actively support start-ups.
Our vision is a city in which everyone can live without fear of discrimination, with equal opportunities and the freedom to develop individually.
We must ensure that all groups in Dortmund have the opportunity to participate, to express their needs and to help shape solutions.
Only in this way can we bring the self-organization of migrants on the way.
Many migrants are still excluded from important democratic processes.
We are committed to ensuring that political co-determination is possible for all people in Dortmund, regardless of their origin.
Participation must not only exist in theory, but must be designed to be accessible and barrier-free in practice.
Dortmund must be a city in which all people have the opportunity to participate, whether in politics, in associations, in the administration or in cultural initiatives.
That is why we will fight for municipal voting rights for all migrants.
MigraDo will help people with an immigration background to become German citizens.
Diversity must also be visible in city life – in sport, in clubs and in cultural offers.
To promote this diversity and make it more accessible is crucial for an inclusive urban society.
For queer life in Dortmund, people should be able to live freely and safely regardless of their sexual identity.
For more information, visit MigraDo’s website or their Facebook page.
Queer diversity is an enrichment for our urban society.
However, queer people still experience discrimination in many areas of life.
Trans*, inter and non-binary people often face additional discrimination.
In addition, there are specific needs for queer seniors, young people and LSBTIQ* people with a migration history, which must be specifically taken into account.
Municipal Election Programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND.
We are fighting for a city in which queer people not only live safely, but can also actively participate and develop.
For this, protection spaces must be expanded, political structures strengthened and queer organizations specifically supported.
It is also particularly important to us to focus on LSBTIQ* youth, who are often confronted with social pressure and prejudices during their identity search.
That is why we will take specific measures to further promote equality, participation and acceptance of LSB TIQ* people in Dortmund.
We want to expand participation formats in order to involve more people.
This also includes people with disabilities, who must be included through barrier-free access and continuous texts.
Young people must be given the opportunity to participate in politics in a low-threshold manner.
This way, we can also work on increasing voter turnout and thus mobilize people for democratic elections.
Democracy must not be an exclusive space.
It must be open to everyone, understandable and accessible.
Whether in the neighbourhood, at school, at work or in the digital space, there needs to be opportunities for participation and co-decision making.
This is what we stand for in Dortmund.
The Municipal Election Programme 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND will critically question political processes and resist manipulation.
The memory of the crimes of National Socialism is a central component of democratic education.
Those who consciously deal with history understand the significance of democratic values and recognise authoritarian and right-wing extremist tendencies early on.
Existing facilities such as mondo mio!
should be maintained and further developed as places of political education and intercultural encounter.
'We are fighting for a city that clearly takes a stand against the right' 'Democracy only works if political decisions are comprehensible and all people have access to relevant information' 'We will continue to prevent cooperation with the AfD by demanding that all democratic parties in Dortmund follow our example' 'Their rhetoric fuels hatred, divides society and relativizes the crimes of National Socialism' 'At the same time, we must name and combat all forms of racism and group-based racism'
Right-wing extremism does not begin with open violence, but already where people are played off against each other, democratic values are called into question and hatred is used as a political strategy.
We are fighting not only against the right-wing extremist scene on the street, but also against those who want to draw this ideology into the municipal election program 2025 BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN DORTMUND.
The AfD has become increasingly radicalized in recent years and is today a party that deliberately incites hatred, engages in racist hate speech and attacks democratic institutions.
We stand firmly on their side and advocate for a city society that clearly positions itself against the Right.
A city is safe when everyone feels safe there, regardless of where they come from, how they look or how they live.
Safety does not begin with blue lights, but with good lighting, accessible contact persons, respect.
This requires a police force that works closely with the public and is transparent, a security service that provides sensitive help and support, and municipal structures that provide protection without stigmatising.
Dortmund aims to reduce spaces of fear, increase the quality of public spaces and low-threshold contact persons.
Review the visual alignment of the Ordnungsamt with the police, as for the majority of citizens they are hardly distinguishable.
Conduct regular external evaluations of police and law enforcement measures in order to systematically identify and combat racism and discrimination.
For the protection of all people.
Only those who feel safe can feel comfortable!
Dortmund Guides' success model and increase subjective safety through their presence without being part of the law enforcement agencies.
Fire department, the rescue service and the disaster control in Dortmund are well organised.
However, the demands on the fire department and disaster control are expected to increase due to the consequences of climate change and the ageing society.
We will continue to expand the municipal specialist department "Violence against Rescue and Order Services" We will oppose fencing, for example by reopening the Amiens square.
We commit ourselves to protecting employees and volunteers in the rescue services from verbal and physical attacks and introduce a reporting system.
We aim to set a clear sign for a safe, violence-free coexistence.
